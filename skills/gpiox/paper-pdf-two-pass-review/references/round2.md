Now produce a deep research critique based on the fact sheet you just extracted.
Constraint: use only the fact sheet plus PDF evidence. No external sources or guesses.
If uncertain, explicitly write `Insufficient evidence`.

Output language: Chinese.
Length: 2000-3000 Chinese words.

Required structure:

# 0. One-line Overall Verdict
- Problem value + method essence + empirical credibility

# 1. Motivation (Why)
## 1.1 Problem positioning
## 1.2 Prior-method bottlenecks (3-5 groups)
## 1.3 Motivation storyline (observation -> contradiction -> hypothesis -> entry point)

# 2. Core Method (How)
## 2.1 Method overview
## 2.2 Core equations (variables + intuition + relation to classic methods)
## 2.3 Design intuition and key trade-offs
## 2.4 Failure boundaries

# 3. Experiments and Results (What)
## 3.1 Validation logic
## 3.2 What results truly show
## 3.3 Ablation insights
## 3.4 Extra evidence from visualizations

# 4. Critical Review
## 4.1 Key assumptions and validity conditions
## 4.2 Baseline fairness and experiment fairness
## 4.3 Reproducibility risks (High/Medium/Low)

# 5. Research Insights
## 5.1 Field contribution
## 5.2 Transferable methodology
## 5.3 Top 3 follow-up directions (prioritized)

# 6. Closing
1) Three takeaways
2) Two major risks
3) One next step if you were the author

Writing constraints:
- For each major claim, add evidence tags: [Evidence: ...].
- Include at least one intuitive analogy per main section.
- Lead with conclusion, then provide evidence.
