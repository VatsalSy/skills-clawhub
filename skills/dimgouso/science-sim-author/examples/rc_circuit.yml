    label: Capacitor voltage vs time
worksheet:
  predict:
    - Predict how the time to reach about 63 percent of the final voltage changes when resistance increases.
    - If capacitance doubles while resistance stays fixed, predict how the curve shape changes.
    - Predict what the final capacitor voltage should be if the source voltage is increased.
  test:
    - Keep the source voltage fixed and compare two runs with different resistances using the voltage-time plot.
    - Hold resistance fixed and compare a small capacitance run with a large capacitance run.
  explain:
    - Explain why the charging curve becomes flatter as the capacitor voltage approaches the source voltage.
    - Explain why changing resistance changes the charging speed without changing the final voltage.
  misconceptions:
    - Does a larger resistance produce a larger final capacitor voltage, or only a slower approach to that voltage?
    - Does the capacitor voltage increase linearly with time throughout the run?
success_criteria:
  - Increasing either R or C increases the time constant of the charging curve.
  - The capacitor voltage approaches the source voltage asymptotically.
