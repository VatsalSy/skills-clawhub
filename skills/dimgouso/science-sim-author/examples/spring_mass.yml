worksheet:
  predict:
    - Predict what happens to the oscillation period if the spring constant increases while mass stays fixed.
    - If damping increases, predict how the displacement peaks will change over time.
    - Predict what happens when the drive amplitude increases from zero while damping stays small.
  test:
    - Keep the initial displacement fixed and compare a low-damping run with a high-damping run using the plot.
    - Hold m, k, and c fixed, then turn on the driving force and compare the motion to the undriven case.
  explain:
    - Explain why the oscillation period changes when the mass changes even though the initial displacement is the same.
    - Explain how damping changes the energy visible in the displacement-time curve.
  misconceptions:
    - Does stronger damping move the equilibrium point, or only change how the motion approaches it?
    - If the mass starts farther from equilibrium, does that automatically change the natural period?
success_criteria:
  - Increasing damping reduces the amplitude envelope over time.
  - Reset restores the exact initial displacement and velocity.
