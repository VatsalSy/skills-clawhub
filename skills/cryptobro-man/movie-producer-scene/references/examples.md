## Example A — Neo-noir chase

- Concept Logline: A burned-out detective tracks a courier through rain-soaked midnight streets before a betrayal at the station.
- Cinematic Scene Prompt: Act as a world-class Hollywood movie producer. Create a neo-noir cinematic scene with a paranoid, high-stakes atmosphere. Scene: a dense downtown district at 2 AM, wet asphalt reflecting crimson signage, elevated train tracks rattling overhead, steam bleeding from street vents. Characters: a detective in a soaked trench coat stalks a nervous courier clutching a silver briefcase while two plainclothes pursuers close in from opposite corners. Visual style: Blade Runner 2049 mood with Michael Mann urban realism and Deakins-inspired contrast control. Camera: wide establishing crane down to shoulder-level tracking, 35mm anamorphic for pursuit, 85mm compression for suspicion beats, whip-pan reveals, one handheld stumble shot. Lighting: practical neon key, sodium-vapor fill, intermittent train-light sweeps, backlit rain for separation. Environment: steady rain, drifting steam, passing taxis, blurred pedestrians, distant sirens. Sound/Music: pulsing analog synth bass, taiko-like heartbeat percussion, squealing rails, wet footfalls, breath detail in close-up. Quality: ultra-realistic, cinematic, high dynamic range, film grain, professional color grading. Output: 2.39:1, 4K.

## Example B — Historical epic interior

- Concept Logline: On the eve of war, a young queen negotiates peace under candlelight while spies listen from the gallery.
- Cinematic Scene Prompt: Act as a world-class Hollywood movie producer. Create a historical epic cinematic scene with a solemn, foreboding atmosphere. Scene: a vast stone council chamber with vaulted ceilings, long oak table, banners swaying in cross-drafts from narrow windows, wax maps spread across the table. Characters: a young queen stands at the head of the table addressing rival envoys while her advisor quietly slides a sealed letter beneath her hand; two hidden spies observe from a shadowed upper gallery. Visual style: Ridley Scott period scale with painterly Rembrandt-inspired composition. Camera: opening 24mm high-angle master, controlled dolly arcs around the queen, 50mm medium close-ups for negotiation beats, 100mm inserts on trembling hands and wax seals. Lighting: warm candle clusters as key, cool moonlight edge from windows, deep negative fill for political tension. Environment: winter wind through stone corridors, candle smoke, fluttering parchment, distant armor movement in halls. Sound/Music: restrained low strings and French horns, reverberant chamber tone, soft armor clinks, parchment crackle.
