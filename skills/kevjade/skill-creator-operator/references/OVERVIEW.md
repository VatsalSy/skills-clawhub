# Skill Creator Operator

This skill is the Operator Vault style "premium" skill scaffolder.

Key patterns:
- First use runs a short conversational wizard (only ask what must be personalized).
- Persist user answers to a workspace config file.
- Keep SKILL.md short, store bulk docs in references/ and KB.
