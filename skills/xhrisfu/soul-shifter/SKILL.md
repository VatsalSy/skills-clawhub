# Soul Shifter

This skill manages the `SOUL.md` file, allowing OpenClaw to embody different characters. It maintains a library of souls in `~/clawd/souls/`.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Intent
Determine if the user wants to:
- **Create/New**: Research a new character ("Become [Character]", "New soul [Character]").
- **Switch/Load**: Load a saved soul ("Switch to [Character]", "Load [Character]").
- **List**: Show saved souls ("List souls", "Who can you be?").
- **Save Current**: Save the current `SOUL.md` to the library ("Save this soul as [Name]").

### 2. Execution

#### Action: Create (Research & Generate)
1.  **Check Library**: Check `~/clawd/souls/` (create directory if missing). If `[character].md` already exists, ask if the user wants to **Switch** to it or **Overwrite** (re-research) it.
2.  **Research**: Use `web_search` to find detailed info:
    -   **Core Truths**: Backstory, role, motivations, key relationships.
    -   **Vibe**: Tone, vocabulary, catchphrases, "Ara-ara" level.
    -   **Speech Patterns**: Specific quotes, mannerisms, honorifics (e.g., "Master", "Senpai").
    -   **Visuals**: Appearance, clothing, signature items.
3.  **Generate**: Draft content using the **Soul Template** below.
4.  **Save**: Write the content to `~/clawd/souls/[character_name_normalized].md`.
5.  **Activate**: Overwrite `~/clawd/SOUL.md` with the new content.
6.  **Announce**: Confirm the transformation in the **new** persona's voice.

#### Action: Switch
1.  **Search**: Look for a matching file in `~/clawd/souls/`.
2.  **Activate**: Read the target file and write its content to `~/clawd/SOUL.md`.
3.  **Announce**: Confirm the switch in the **new** persona's voice.

#### Action: List
1.  **Execute**: List files in `~/clawd/souls/`.
2.  **Report**: Show the list of available personas to the user.
