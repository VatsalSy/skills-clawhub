Typical targets are <5% unplanned downtime. At 12.5% (14/112 hrs), this indicates either:\n- Inadequate preventive maintenance on hydraulics, heaters, or controls\n- Worn tooling causing frequent stoppages for adjustments\n- Material feed issues (contaminated resin, moisture, inconsistent viscosity)\n\n**Performance (31% of losses)** — Running at 91.8% performance suggests the machine is capable but not optimized. Common causes:\n- Cycle time creep due to conservative temperature/pressure settings\n- Injection speed reductions to compensate for tooling wear\n- Micro-stops for part ejection issues or gate trimming\n\n**Quality (17% of losses)** — 5% scrap rate is manageable but improvable. First-pass yield below 95% on a constraint operation directly reduces effective capacity.\n\n### Recommended Priority Action\n\n**#1 Priority: Unplanned Downtime Reduction**\n\nImplement immediate preventive maintenance intensification on Machine #3:\n\n1. **Daily operator checks** (15 min/shift): hydraulic fluid level, heating zone temperatures, cycle counter review for trending\n2. **Weekly PM enhancement** (2 hrs Saturday): mould inspection, water line flow verification, sensor calibration\n3. **Monthly deep maintenance** (4 hrs): hydraulic filter replacement, heater element resistance check, screw/barrel wear assessment\n\n**Expected ROI:** Reducing unplanned downtime from 14 hrs to 7 hrs/week (plant benchmark) recovers $4,550/week at a maintenance cost increase of ~$800/week. **Net gain: $3,750/week.**\n\n**#2 Priority: Cycle Time Optimization Study**\n\nAfter downtime stabilizes, conduct a 2-week cycle time study with process engineering:\n- Validate current temperature/pressure profiles against resin specifications  \n- Test injection speed increases in 5% increments with first-piece quality validation\n- Target: 42-second cycle time (7% improvement) = additional $1,400/week throughput\n\n**Financial Justification:** $17,420/week in losses × 52 weeks = **$905,840 annual opportunity.** Even a 50% reduction in losses justifies significant improvement investment.\n\n### Immediate Actions (This Week)\n\n1. **Root cause analysis on last week's 14-hour downtime events** — maintenance logs, operator shift reports, actual vs. planned maintenance schedule review\n2. **Tooling inspection** — pull the mould this Saturday for wear assessment, especially cavity flash, gate wear, and ejector pin condition  \n3. **Resin quality verification** — moisture content, melt flow index testing on current lot\n\nThis constraint is underperforming significantly.

      "agent_response": "## Bottleneck Analysis for Fortis Assembly\n\n### True Constraint Identification\n\n**The SMT Pick-and-Place line is your constraint**, not wave soldering despite the visible WIP accumulation there.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- SMT utilisation: 92% (highest across all work centres)\n- Available daily capacity at SMT: 213.3 units (16 hours × 60 min ÷ 4.5 min cycle time)\n- Current daily demand: 180 units\n- Utilisation verification: 180 ÷ 213.3 = 84.4% theoretical minimum\n\nThe 92% actual utilisation indicates SMT is consuming nearly all available capacity when accounting for changeovers, micro-stops, and material delays. This work centre has the least protective capacity cushion.\n\n### Why Wave Soldering's WIP Queue is Misleading\n\nThe 340-unit queue at wave soldering is a **symptom, not the cause** of the bottleneck. Here's what's actually happening:\n\n1. **Batch-dumping from upstream:** SMT likely processes boards in batches and releases them all at once to wave soldering, creating artificial queue spikes.\n\n2. **Utilisation vs. queue relationship:** Wave soldering runs at only 78% utilisation with a 3.0-minute cycle time. This work centre has excess capacity (22% protective capacity) but appears overloaded due to poor upstream release timing.\n\n3. **Queue time calculation:** 340 units ÷ (16 hours × 60 min ÷ 3.0 min) = 1.06 days of queue time. This excessive queue exists because SMT's 92% utilisation creates irregular, lumpy releases rather than smooth flow.\n\n**Root cause:** SMT's near-constraint status creates batch processing behavior that starves wave soldering intermittently, then floods it when batches release.\n\n### Immediate Constraint Management Actions\n\n#### 1. Exploit SMT (Drum) - Priority 1\n- **Eliminate SMT idle time:** Pre-stage all reels, programs, and fixtures. SMT should never wait for material or setup.\n- **Reduce SMT changeovers:** Group similar board types in campaigns. Target 15% reduction in changeover frequency through better sequencing.\n- **Implement first-piece-right discipline:** SMT setup errors waste precious constraint capacity. Assign your most experienced technician to SMT program verification.\n- **Run SMT through breaks:** Stagger operator lunches so SMT never stops for breaks.\n\n#### 2. Subordinate Wave Soldering (Buffer Management)\n- **Implement controlled release:** SMT should release boards to wave soldering at a steady rate (every 2 hours in small batches of ~22 units) rather than dumping 100+ units at once.\n- **Establish SMT-to-wave buffer:** Target 4-6 hours of wave soldering work (80-120 units) as a protective buffer. Current 340-unit queue is 3× too large and ties up excessive WIP.\n- **Wave soldering schedule subordination:** Wave soldering should process work in the sequence SMT releases it, not by optimizing its own efficiency.\n\n#### 3. Monitor Buffer Penetration\nImplement buffer zones at wave soldering:\n- **Green (80-120 units):** SMT well-protected, normal operations\n- **Yellow (40-80 units):** Warning - expedite any blocked SMT work\n- **Red (<40 units):** Critical - immediate escalation, SMT may starve\n\n#### 4. Validate Constraint Protection\n- **Downstream capacity verification:** Manual Assembly (65% utilisation) and Testing (71% utilisation) have adequate protective capacity and shouldn't constrain SMT output.\n- **Quality gate before SMT:** Ensure all incoming PCBs are quality-verified before reaching SMT. Every defective board processed at the constraint is wasted capacity.\n\n### Expected Results (4-week implementation)\n\n- **SMT utilisation:** Increase to 94-95% through idle time elimination\n- **Wave soldering queue:** Reduce to 100-120 units through controlled release\n- **Plant throughput:** Increase by 8-12% (185-200 units/day) without capital investment\n- **WIP reduction:** ~220 units freed up from wave soldering queue = ~$15-25K inventory reduction\n\n### Management Communication\n\n**To the plant floor:** \"The boards piling up at wave soldering are there because SMT is our constraint and releases work in batches. We're implementing controlled release to smooth the flow and reduce that pile while increasing plant output.\"\n\n**To management:** \"SMT is our true bottleneck at 92% utilisation. The wave soldering queue is a symptom of batch dumping from the constraint. Our constraint exploitation plan will increase throughput 8-12% with zero capital expenditure.\"\n\nThis is a classic case where the visible problem (WIP queue) distracts from the real constraint. Focus all improvement efforts on SMT utilisation and controlled release to wave soldering.",

The work can be completed by Tuesday afternoon for a Friday due date.\n\n2. **Single-Day Completion Possible:** With 15 hours total processing time against 8-hour shifts, the work spans into a second day. However, all operations could theoretically run on consecutive shifts if required.\n\n3. **No Resource Conflicts Assumed:** This analysis assumes dedicated work centre availability. In reality, these work centres likely serve multiple work orders, requiring finite capacity scheduling to determine actual start times.\n\n4. **Heat Treatment as Potential Bottleneck:** Op 30 has the longest single operation time (5 hours setup + run). If Heat Treatment is a constraint work centre, this operation would drive the critical path in a multi-order environment.\n\n### Scheduling Recommendation\n\n**Recommended Approach:** Use backward scheduling with the latest start date of Thursday, September 25. This preserves maximum scheduling flexibility for higher-priority or tighter-deadline work orders earlier in the week while still comfortably meeting the Friday due date.\n\n**Alternative Option:** If CNC Milling is the plant constraint, consider forward scheduling from Monday to secure constraint capacity early, even though it's not required for this due date. The 2.5-day buffer provides ample protection against minor disruptions.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Low risk of delivery miss due to substantial float.

Drum Schedule Design (Titanium Machining Centre TMC-01)\n\n### Primary Scheduling Rules\n- **Drum tempo:** 40 parts/day = 2.5 parts/hour fixed rate\n- **Schedule horizon:** 5-day rolling window (firm), 10-day visibility (tentative)\n- **Frozen zone:** Next 24 hours — no sequence changes without production manager approval\n\n### Changeover Optimization\nCurrent state: 3 changeovers/day × 25 minutes = 75 minutes lost daily\n**Target: Reduce to 2 changeovers/day through part family grouping**\n\n**Part family consolidation strategy:**\n- Group titanium parts by alloy grade (Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo, commercially pure Ti)\n- Within grade, sequence by complexity (simple → complex to minimize tooling changes)\n- Campaign schedule: minimum 15-part runs per family before changeover\n\n**Expected recovery:** 25 minutes/day = 2.1 additional parts/day capacity\n\n### Drum Schedule Format\n```\nTMC-01 Daily Schedule — [Date]\nTarget Output: 42 parts/day (after changeover optimization)\n\nSequence | Part Family | Qty | Start | End | Changeover\n---------|-------------|-----|-------|-----|------------\n1        | Ti-6Al-4V Simple | 18 | 06:00 | 12:36 | —\n2        | Ti-6Al-4V Complex | 12 | 13:01 | 17:25 | 25 min\n3        | CP-Ti Brackets | 12 | 17:50 | 22:14 | 25 min\n```\n\n## 2. Buffer Design and Monitoring\n\n### Buffer Duration Calculation\n**Formula:** Buffer = Upstream Lead Time × Buffer Factor\n\n- Upstream lead time: 12 hours\n- Buffer factor: 0.5 (moderate reliability with known variability)\n- **Constraint buffer duration: 6 hours**\n\n**Physical buffer target:** 6 hours × 2.5 parts/hour = **15 parts staged at TMC-01**\n\n### Buffer Zones and Triggers\n\n| Zone | Parts in Buffer | Buffer % | Status | Action Required |\n|------|----------------|----------|--------|-----------------|\n| **Green** | 11-15 parts | 67-100% | Protected | Normal operations |\n| **Yellow** | 6-10 parts | 33-66% | Warning | Expedite upstream. Check for delays. |\n| **Red** | 1-5 parts | 1-33% | Critical | Immediate escalation. Overtime upstream if needed. |\n| **Black** | 0 parts | 0% | Starving | TMC-01 stops. Emergency response. Every minute = $32 lost throughput. |\n\n### Buffer Monitoring Protocol\n**Check frequency:** Every 2 hours during production shifts\n**Responsibility:** Shift supervisor + scheduler\n**Escalation:** Red zone = notify production manager within 15 minutes\n\n## 3. Rope Mechanism (Release Control)\n\n### Release Rate Control\n**Release trigger:** When buffer drops to 12 parts, release next batch from sawing\n**Release quantity:** 6-part batches (half-day TMC-01 consumption)\n**Release frequency:** 3 times per day (every 8 hours)\n\n### Upstream Pacing\n**Sawing station release schedule:**\n- 06:00: Release 6 parts for 18:00 TMC-01 consumption\n- 14:00: Release 6 parts for 02:00+1 TMC-01 consumption  \n- 22:00: Release 6 parts for 10:00+1 TMC-01 consumption\n\n### Work Order Release Control\n```\nDaily Release Pattern:\n- Maximum 18 parts in upstream pipeline at any time\n- TMC-01 buffer target: 15 parts\n- Pipeline total: 33 parts maximum (15 buffer + 18 upstream WIP)\n```\n\n**Rope discipline:** Never release more than the constraint can consume + buffer replenishment, regardless of upstream capacity availability.\n\n## 4. Constraint Exploitation Actions\n\n### Immediate Actions (0 capital investment)\n\n**1. Eliminate Constraint Idle Time**\n- Pre-stage next job tooling during current job run (external setup)\n- Stagger operator breaks — TMC-01 never stops for breaks\n- Pre-position crane/material handling for changeovers\n- **Target:** Reduce micro-stops from 3% to 1% = 19 minutes/day = 1.6 parts\n\n**2. Quality Gates Before Constraint**\n- Move first-article inspection to CNC rough machining output\n- Reject defective parts before they consume TMC-01 time\n- **Current yield at TMC-01:** ~98% → Target: 99.5% through upstream filtering\n\n**3. Operator Assignment**\n- Assign most experienced titanium machinist to TMC-01 permanently\n- Cross-train 2 backup operators (currently single point of failure)\n- Dedicate setup technician to TMC-01 during changeovers\n\n**4. Preventive Maintenance**\n- Execute all TMC-01 PM during planned weekend windows only\n- Implement daily operator checks (spindle temperature, coolant levels, tool wear)\n- **Target:** Reduce unplanned downtime from ~2% to <1%\n\n### Medium-term Improvements (Weeks 2-8)\n\n**5. Tooling Optimization**\n- Implement quick-change tooling system for 15-minute changeovers (vs. current 25)\n- Standardize tool offsets and work holding across part families\n- **Expected benefit:** Additional 30 minutes/day = 2.5 parts\n\n**6. Upstream Reliability**\n- Install backup saw blades and streamline blade change procedure (address sawing breakages)\n- Implement tighter heat treatment cycle control (±30 minutes vs. current ±1 hour)\n\n## 5. Subordination of Non-Constraints\n\n### Heat Treatment (60% utilization)\n**New operating principle:** Process batches to feed TMC-01 schedule, not to maximize heat treatment efficiency\n- Batch size: 6 parts (matches rope release)\n- Frequency: Every 8 hours (matches TMC-01 consumption)\n- **Deliberately plan 40% idle time** to absorb upstream variability\n\n### CNC Rough Machining (72% utilization) \n**Sprint capacity required:** Must clear any backlog within 4 hours to prevent buffer penetration\n- Assign floating operator when queue builds above 2-hour worth\n- Maintain 28% protective capacity — do not optimize rough machining independently\n\n### Sawing (85% utilization)\n**Reduce to 75% through rope control**\n- Current overproduction creates excess WIP downstream\n- Subordinate saw release rate to rope signal only\n- Use 10% freed capacity for blade maintenance and setup optimization\n\n## 6. Performance Metrics and Monitoring\n\n### Daily Constraint Performance\n| Metric | Target | Red Flag | Action |\n|--------|---------|----------|---------|\n| TMC-01 Output | 42 parts/day | <38 parts | Root cause analysis |\n| Buffer Penetration | <33% in red zone | >20% time in red | Upstream capacity review |\n| Changeovers per Day | ≤2 | >2 | Part family sequencing review |\n| Unplanned Downtime | <1% | >2% | Maintenance escalation |\n\n### Weekly System Performance\n- **Throughput:** Total parts through TMC-01\n- **Flow time:** Average time from raw material to finished goods  \n- **WIP turns:** Weekly throughput ÷ average WIP value\n- **Buffer stability:** Trend in buffer zone distribution\n\n## 7. Implementation Timeline\n\n**Week 1:** Drum scheduling and buffer zone setup\n- Install physical buffer staging area at TMC-01\n- Train shift supervisors on buffer monitoring\n- Implement changeover reduction (part family grouping)\n\n**Week 2-3:** Rope mechanism activation  \n- Establish release triggers and upstream pacing\n- Subordinate upstream work centres to rope signals\n- Begin operator cross-training program\n\n**Week 4-6:** Exploitation actions\n- Quick-change tooling implementation\n- Preventive maintenance schedule adjustment\n- Upstream reliability improvements\n\n**Week 8:** System validation and fine-tuning\n- Analyze 30-day performance data\n- Adjust buffer factors if needed\n- Document standard operating procedures\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- TMC-01 output: 40 → 45 parts/day (+12.5%)\n- Lead time reduction: 25% through WIP reduction\n- Buffer penetration in red zone: <10% of time\n- Plant throughput limited only by market demand, not internal constraints\n\nThis DBR system transforms TMC-01 from a bottleneck creating chaos to a drumbeat that orchestrates the entire plant's flow, maximizing aerospace component throughput while maintaining the precision quality standards required for aviation applications.",

4.5 = 11.5 hours/day\n- Current changeover cost: 4.5 hrs × $850/hr = **$3,825/day in lost throughput**\n- Annual changeover cost: $3,825 × 250 working days = **$956,250**\n\n**Capacity Utilisation:**\n- Daily demand: 25,000 parts/month ÷ 20 working days = 1,250 parts/day\n- Current capacity: 11.5 hrs × 120 parts/hr = 1,380 parts/day\n- Utilisation: 1,250 ÷ 1,380 = **90.6%** — very tight, minimal buffer\n\n### Campaign Schedule Analysis\n\n**Proposed Weekly Campaign Structure:**\n\n| Day | Colour | Customer | Parts/Week | Campaign Hours | Setup Buffer |\n|-----|--------|----------|------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Monday | Gloss Black | AutoCo | 2,000 | 16.7 hrs | Split Mon-Tue |\n| Tuesday AM | Gloss Black (cont.) | AutoCo | - | 4.2 hrs | - |\n| Tuesday PM-Wed | RAL 7035 Grey | BuildCo | 1,500 | 12.5 hrs | - |\n| Wednesday PM | Safety Yellow | MachineryCo | 1,000 | 8.3 hrs | Wed PM-Thu AM |\n| Thursday PM | Beige | HVAC Corp | 625 | 5.2 hrs | - |\n| Friday AM | Matte White | FurnitureCo | 750 | 6.3 hrs | - |\n| Friday PM | Custom Red | SignCo | 375 | 3.1 hrs | - |\n\n**Campaign Performance:**\n- Changeovers per week: 6 colour changes (vs. 30 under mixed-model)\n- Weekly changeover time: 6 × 45 min = 4.5 hours (vs. 22.5 hours mixed-model)\n- Weekly changeover cost savings: 18 hrs × $850/hr = **$15,300/week**\n- Annual savings: $15,300 × 50 weeks = **$765,000**\n\n### Inventory Impact Analysis\n\n**Current Mixed-Model WIP:**\n- Average batch size: ~200 parts (hourly production with setup optimization)\n- WIP carrying cost: minimal due to quick turns\n\n**Campaign Inventory Requirements:**\n\n| Customer | Delivery Frequency | Campaign Batch | Cycle Stock | Weekly Carrying Cost |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| AutoCo | Weekly JIT | 2,000 | 1,000 avg | $120 |\n| BuildCo | Weekly | 1,500 | 750 avg | $90 |\n| MachineryCo | Bi-weekly | 1,000 | 1,000 avg | $120 |\n| HVAC Corp | Bi-weekly | 625 | 625 avg | $75 |\n| FurnitureCo | Monthly | 750 | 1,125 avg | $135 |\n| SignCo | Monthly | 375 | 563 avg | $68 |\n\n**Total additional inventory carrying cost: $608/week = $31,600/year**\n\n### Customer Delivery Constraint Analysis\n\n**Critical Constraint: AutoCo's Weekly JIT**\n- Requires 2,000 parts every Monday\n- Campaign produces 2,000 parts Monday-Tuesday AM\n- **Risk:** If Monday production disrupts (breakdown, quality hold), AutoCo's Tuesday delivery is at risk\n- **Mitigation:** Build 1-day safety stock (250 parts) of Gloss Black, refresh weekly\n\n**BuildCo Weekly Delivery:**\n- Compatible with Wednesday production, Friday delivery pattern\n\n**Bi-weekly customers (MachineryCo, HVAC Corp):**\n- Campaign batches align well with delivery windows\n- Inventory turns every 2 weeks, acceptable carrying cost\n\n**Monthly customers (FurnitureCo, SignCo):**\n- Higher cycle stock but lowest volume — minimal cost impact\n- Production can flex within the month for other priorities\n\n### Recommended Hybrid Approach\n\n**Primary Recommendation: Modified Campaign with JIT Exception**\n\n1. **Base Campaign Schedule:** Run the weekly colour campaign as outlined\n2. **AutoCo Exception Handling:** \n   - Build 500-part safety stock of Gloss Black (refreshed weekly)\n   - If AutoCo orders spike or Monday production disrupts, insert a mid-week Gloss Black mini-campaign (2-3 hours) to top up inventory\n   - This adds ~1 extra changeover every 3-4 weeks vs. pure campaign\n\n**Financial Impact:**\n- Changeover savings: $765,000/year (vs. mixed-model)\n- Additional inventory carrying: $31,600/year\n- AutoCo safety stock carrying: 500 parts × $0.12/week × 52 weeks = $3,120/year\n- Occasional AutoCo mini-campaigns: ~15 extra changeovers/year × $850/hr × 0.75 hr = $9,560/year\n\n**Net annual benefit: $765,000 - $31,600 - $3,120 - $9,560 = $720,720**\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategies\n\n**Quality Risk:**\n- Campaign runs create larger batches — a quality issue affects more parts\n- Implement first-piece inspection after every colour change\n- Hold first 50 parts from each campaign until quality approval\n\n**Equipment Risk:**\n- 16-hour constraint utilisation leaves no recovery time for breakdowns\n- Negotiate Saturday overtime availability for recovery\n- Maintain 1-day finished goods buffer for AutoCo as line-down protection\n\n**Demand Variability:**\n- Monthly demand shown is average — actual weekly demand will vary ±15-20%\n- Size weekly campaigns based on 4-week rolling average demand\n- Maintain flexibility to split large campaigns across adjacent days if demand spikes\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n**Week 1-2: Transition Preparation**\n- Build initial safety stocks for all customers under current mixed-model\n- Pre-communicate the new delivery pattern to each customer\n- Train operators on the campaign sequence and colour change procedures\n\n**Week 3: Pilot Campaign**\n- Run the full weekly campaign schedule\n- Monitor changeover times, quality, and delivery performance\n- Document any issues or timing adjustments needed\n\n**Week 4+: Full Implementation**\n- Lock in the campaign schedule as the standard weekly pattern\n- Monitor weekly performance: changeover time actuals, inventory turns, customer satisfaction\n- Monthly review of demand patterns — adjust campaign sizing if customer mix shifts significantly\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n- Changeover time: <4.5 hours/week (vs. 22.5 current)\n- On-time delivery: >95% for all customers\n- Inventory turns: >12× annually for weekly customers, >6× for monthly customers\n- Quality: First-pass yield >98% (campaign quality should improve vs. mixed-model due to longer runs)\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Campaign scheduling delivers a $720K annual benefit** through dramatic changeover reduction, with manageable inventory carrying cost increases. The key success factor is managing AutoCo's JIT requirement through strategic safety stock and occasional flexibility insertions. The 80% reduction in changeovers (from 1,500 to 300 per year) fundamentally transforms the operation from changeover-constrained to throughput-optimized.\n\nThe constraint utilisation will drop from 90.6% to 85%, creating protective capacity for demand variability and recovery from disruptions — a significant operational improvement beyond the pure cost savings.",

      "agent_response": "## Diagnosis: Confirmed Shifting Bottleneck\n\n**Root Cause:** Product mix shift from aerospace-intensive (5-axis heavy) to medical device-intensive (EDM heavy) has moved the constraint from 5-axis CNC to Wire EDM.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- EDM utilisation jumped from 71% to 91% (+20 percentage points)\n- EDM WIP queue exploded from 3 to 18 parts (+500% increase)\n- 5-axis utilisation dropped from 93% to 78% (-15 percentage points) \n- 5-axis WIP queue dropped from 12 to 4 parts (-67% decrease)\n- Remaining week mix: 60% medical (EDM-heavy) confirms this shift will persist\n\n**Validation Test:** EDM is now the constraint because:\n1. Highest utilisation (91% vs 78% for 5-axis)\n2. WIP accumulation upstream indicates true bottleneck\n3. Adding 1 hour to EDM capacity would increase plant output; adding 1 hour to 5-axis would not\n\n## Re-Designation Decision: YES\n\n**Duration Assessment:** This is a persistent shift (rest of week), not temporary (2-3 hours). With 60% medical device mix remaining and EDM cycle times nearly 2x longer than 5-axis (45 min vs 25 min per part), EDM will remain the constraint through Friday.\n\n## Immediate Schedule Adjustments (Next 4 Hours)\n\n### 1. EDM Queue Management\n**Action:** Re-sequence the 18-part EDM queue by priority:\n- Medical device jobs with customer due dates this week: highest priority\n- Medical device jobs due next week: medium priority  \n- Any non-medical work in EDM queue: lowest priority\n\n**Setup Optimization:** Review EDM setups in the queue. If wire diameter or material changes create sequence-dependent setup times, optimize the sequence to minimize total changeover time while respecting due date priorities.\n\n### 2. 5-Axis Release Rate Control\n**Action:** Immediately slow the 5-axis release rate to match EDM's consumption rate:\n- EDM processes 1 part per 45 minutes = 1.33 parts/hour\n- 5-axis should release medical device work to EDM at ≤ 1.33 parts/hour\n- Continue running 5-axis at full rate on aerospace work that bypasses EDM\n\n### 3. Buffer Establishment\n**Action:** Establish a 4-hour time buffer protecting the EDM:\n- Medical device parts should arrive at EDM staging 4 hours before EDM is scheduled to process them\n- Current 18-part queue represents ~13.5 hours of work — this is excessive and indicates upstream over-release\n- Target queue: 6-8 parts maximum (4-6 hours of buffer + current work)\n\n## Constraint Protection Measures\n\n### 1. Operator Assignment\n**Action:** Assign your most experienced EDM operator for the remainder of the week. If the current operator needs relief, stagger breaks and shift changes so the EDM never stops during production hours.\n\n### 2. Material Pre-Staging\n**Action:** Pre-stage all consumables for EDM operations:\n- Wire spools pre-positioned at machine\n- Deionized water tanks topped off\n- All fixtures and workholding staged in sequence\n- Eliminate any material-related delays\n\n### 3. Quality Pre-Screening\n**Action:** Implement upstream inspection before parts reach EDM queue:\n- First-piece inspection on 5-axis operations feeding EDM\n- Any dimensional nonconformances caught before consuming EDM capacity\n- EDM operator focuses on cutting, not quality sorting\n\n## Buffer Management Adjustments\n\n### 1. Reduce 5-Axis Buffer\n**Previous:** 5-axis had protective buffer as the constraint\n**New:** Convert 5-axis buffer time to productive capacity for aerospace work\n**Action:** Release aerospace work to 5-axis more aggressively since it no longer needs constraint protection\n\n### 2. Establish EDM Buffer Zones\n**Green Zone (0-4 parts in queue):** Normal operations\n**Yellow Zone (5-8 parts):** Monitor upstream flow, ensure no additional releases without EDM consumption\n**Red Zone (>8 parts):** Stop upstream releases, focus on clearing queue\n\n**Current Status:** Deep red zone with 18 parts — immediate queue reduction required\n\n### 3. Downstream Flow Protection\n**Action:** Ensure Surface Grinding and CMM Inspection can absorb EDM output without creating a secondary bottleneck:\n- Both currently at 67% and 62% utilisation respectively — adequate headroom\n- Verify both have capacity for increased EDM throughput as queue clears\n\n## Schedule Lock and Communication\n\n### 1. Frozen Zone Extension\n**Action:** Extend the normal 48-hour frozen zone to 72 hours for the EDM queue only. With 18 parts queued, frequent re-sequencing creates more disruption than optimization benefit.\n\n### 2. Communication Plan\n**Immediate (next 30 minutes):**\n- Notify EDM operator of new constraint status and priority sequence\n- Brief 5-axis operator on reduced release rate for medical device work\n- Update material handlers on revised staging priorities\n\n**Shift Handover:**\n- Document constraint shift in handover notes\n- Emphasize EDM as new constraint requiring protection\n- Provide updated buffer targets and queue limits\n\n### 3. Customer Impact Assessment\n**Action:** Review delivery commitments for Friday and next week:\n- Medical device orders may see improved delivery as EDM gets constraint focus\n- Aerospace orders should be unaffected as 5-axis has excess capacity\n- If any medical device orders were at risk due to EDM queue backup, they may now recover\n\n## Success Metrics for Rest of Week\n\n**EDM Performance:**\n- Target utilisation: maintain >90% \n- Queue size: reduce to 6-8 parts by Thursday\n- Setup efficiency: minimize wire/material changeovers\n\n**System Flow:**\n- Eliminate WIP growth at EDM\n- Maintain 5-axis throughput on aerospace work\n- Keep downstream operations (grinding, CMM) fed but not overwhelmed\n\nThis constraint shift is now properly managed with EDM protected as the new drum, buffers appropriately sized, and upstream flow controlled to prevent queue buildup.",

She has been off since 3:30 PM, making her eligible to return at 11:30 PM (8-hour rest satisfied).\n\n**Script:** \"Maria, this is [scheduler name] at PharmaTech night shift. Jamal called in sick and we have 6 hours of coating work for the MedSupply lot due Wednesday. Can you come in for a split shift starting 11:30 PM? This would be voluntary overtime at time-and-a-half rate. The coating run should finish by 5:30 AM, giving you time to rest before your regular day shift if needed.\"\n\n**If Maria accepts:** Authorize 6 hours voluntary OT. Document union compliance (8-hour rest observed, voluntary OT). Coating starts 11:30 PM, finishes 5:30 AM Wednesday.\n\n**If Maria declines:** Proceed to Step 2.\n\n### Step 2: Regulatory Compliance Decision (11:00 PM)\n\n**Critical determination:** No other night-shift operator can legally run the coating line under FDA regulations. R. Chen is 2 weeks from qualification - using him would be a GMP violation regardless of skill level.\n\n**Action:** If Maria is unavailable, **stop the coating line.** Document the decision: \"Coating operations suspended due to absence of qualified operator. FDA 21 CFR Part 211 compliance maintained.\"\n\n### Step 3: Re-sequence Night Shift Work (11:00-11:15 PM)\n\n**Immediate reallocation:**\n- **R. Chen:** Continue tableting operations (qualified). Maximize tablet production for other batches.\n- **S. Williams:** Granulation and blending prep work for tomorrow's day shift batches.\n- **T. O'Brien:** Packaging operations on completed lots. Material staging for coating resumption.\n\n**Critical:** Keep non-coating operations productive. The constraint may shift temporarily, but don't idle the entire night shift.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Wednesday Shipment Impact (11:15 PM)\n\n**Scenario Analysis:**\n\n**If Maria comes in (11:30 PM - 5:30 AM):**\n- Coating completes 5:30 AM Wednesday\n- Quality testing: 2 hours (standard for coated tablets)\n- Packaging: 3 hours\n- Ship time: 10:30 AM Wednesday ✅ **On schedule**\n\n**If coating waits until day shift:**\n- Maria's regular shift: 6:00 AM - 2:30 PM\n- Coating: 6:00 AM - 12:00 PM (6 hours)\n- Quality testing: 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM\n- Packaging: 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM\n- Ship time: 5:00 PM Wednesday ✅ **Still achievable**\n\n### Step 5: Customer Communication (If Needed)\n\n**Only if day-shift coating creates risk:** If Wednesday shipping requires pickup before 5:00 PM, notify MedSupply Corp immediately:\n\n*\"Due to an operator availability issue, Lot TC-2025-0892 will be ready for pickup at 5:00 PM Wednesday instead of morning. This maintains our Wednesday commitment while ensuring full GMP compliance. Please confirm if afternoon pickup works for your delivery schedule.\"*\n\n## Immediate Actions - Next 30 Minutes\n\n### 11:00 PM - Document and Escalate\n- **Production Manager:** Email/text notification about Jamal's absence and response plan\n- **Quality Assurance Manager:** Notify of potential day-shift coating (may affect QA resource allocation)\n- **Document everything:** Time of absence, operator contacted, union compliance verification, coating line status\n\n### 11:15 PM - Publish Revised Night Schedule\n\n```\nREVISED NIGHT SHIFT SCHEDULE - 10/45/2025\nCoating Line: STOPPED - Operator absence (FDA compliance)\nAlternative assignments:\n- R. Chen: Continue tableting operations (Lines 1-2)\n- S. Williams: Granulation prep for tomorrow's day shift batches\n- T. O'Brien: Package completed lots, stage materials for coating resumption\n```\n\n### 11:30 PM - Execute Plan\n- If Maria arrives: Resume coating immediately with full documentation\n- If no Maria: Confirm day-shift coating plan with incoming day scheduler\n\n## Systemic Risk Mitigation\n\n### Immediate (Next Week)\n**CAPA Initiation:** Submit Corrective and Preventive Action request for coating operator single-point-of-failure.\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Cross-train 2 additional operators** on tablet coating (target: R. Chen + 1 day-shift operator)\n2. **Accelerate R. Chen's qualification** from 2 weeks to 1 week with focused training\n3. **Review weekend/holiday coverage** - coating operations should not depend on a single person\n\n### Medium Term (Next Month)\n**Operator Matrix Analysis:** Review all FDA-regulated operations for single-point-of-failure risks. Prioritize cross-training based on:\n- Business impact of operation stoppage\n- Customer delivery criticality\n- Regulatory consequences of non-compliance\n\n## Cost-Benefit Documentation\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n- **Overtime cost:** ~$480 (6 hrs × $80/hr including premium) if Maria accepts\n- **Compliance value:** Avoiding FDA citation (potential $15,000+ penalty)\n- **Customer relationship:** Maintaining Wednesday delivery commitment\n- **Alternative cost:** Day-shift overtime displacement ~$320\n\n**Recommended authorization:** Up to $500 overtime to resolve this incident while maintaining compliance and delivery commitment.\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nThis incident demonstrates that **regulatory compliance is non-negotiable** - we protect FDA requirements first, then optimize around that constraint. The 45-minute delay in reaching Maria (8-hour rest requirement) is manageable, but the 2-week qualification gap for R. Chen represents a systemic vulnerability that needs immediate attention.\n\nThe coating line's 6-hour requirement can be met Wednesday either through split-shift (preferred) or day-shift reallocation. Both options maintain GMP compliance and delivery commitment.",

Every hour matters.\n\n---\n\n## Priority Triage (7:30–8:00 AM)\n\n### Step 1: Segregate Work Orders by Material Dependency\n\n**STEEL-DEPENDENT (Blocked until Friday AM):**\n- 6 work orders, 48 constraint hours\n- Status: HOLD — cannot proceed\n\n**NON-STEEL (Can run immediately):**\n- Remaining 16 work orders\n- Must identify which of the 8 urgent orders are steel-dependent\n\n### Step 2: Critical Path Analysis for Urgent Orders\n\nFrom the 8 urgent work orders due within 5 days, classify by material:\n- **Urgent + Steel-dependent:** Cannot start until Friday — Friday-Tuesday window for completion\n- **Urgent + Non-steel:** Can start immediately — must prioritise for Wed-Thu slot\n\n### Step 3: Capacity Allocation Decision\n\n**Wednesday-Thursday (24.8 hours available):**\n- Allocate 100% to urgent non-steel orders\n- Run constraint through all breaks (operators stagger 10-min breaks, machine never stops)\n- Implement 2-hour shift extensions Wed-Thu if needed\n\n---\n\n## Immediate Actions (8:00–9:00 AM)\n\n### Labour Workaround — URGENT\n1. **Contact night shift operators for overtime coverage**\n   - Request 2 night shift operators for 4-hour overlap (10:00 AM–2:00 PM)\n   - This provides break coverage without stopping the constraint\n   - Cost: 8 hours overtime vs. lost constraint throughput value\n\n2. **Cross-trained operator check**\n   - Verify if any other operators (maintenance, setup techs) hold laser certification\n   - Activate emergency operator call list\n\n3. **Break coverage solution**\n   - **DO NOT** stop the constraint for operator breaks\n   - Stagger 10-minute micro-breaks instead of 15-minute standard breaks\n   - Assign material handler to monitor laser during operator micro-breaks\n\n### Material Expediting\n1. **Verify Friday AM delivery commitment** with backup supplier\n   - Request exact arrival time (8:00 AM target)\n   - Confirm material will be pre-certified (mill certificates reviewed before shipping)\n\n2. **Steel inventory audit**\n   - Physical check for any usable steel inventory from alternate stock\n   - Review scrap bin for partial sheets that could serve smaller work orders\n\n### Equipment Management\n1. **Do not attempt field repairs** on the resonator — risk of total laser failure\n2. **Schedule resonator replacement for Tuesday night shift** (minimise production impact)\n3. **Document degraded performance** — track actual cycle times to refine capacity estimates\n\n---\n\n## Recovery Schedule Framework\n\n### Phase 1: Wed-Thu Constraint Sprint (24.8 hrs available)\n**Objective:** Complete all urgent non-steel orders\n\n**Sequencing Rules:**\n1. Urgent orders due Thursday/Friday first\n2. Within urgent orders: shortest processing time first (maximise completed orders)\n3. Group similar materials to minimise changeover time between sheet types\n\n**Labour Plan:**\n- Day shift: 3 operators + 2 overtime operators (10 AM–2 PM overlap)\n- Extended shifts: 6:00 AM–8:00 PM both days (14-hour operations)\n- Break staggering: 10-min micro-breaks, laser never stops\n\n### Phase 2: Friday Recovery Preparation\n**Friday 6:00 AM–8:00 AM:** Steel receipt and quality verification\n**Friday 8:00 AM onward:** Steel-dependent work orders begin\n\n**Steel Order Prioritisation:**\n1. Urgent steel orders by due date\n2. Highest-margin steel orders\n3. Longest-processing steel orders (prevent end-of-week crunch)\n\n### Phase 3: Weekend Recovery Decision Point\n**Friday 5:00 PM Assessment:** \n- If constraint recovery is behind schedule: Authorise Saturday production\n- If on track: Use Saturday for resonator prep work (staging, tooling prep)\n\n---\n\n## Customer Communication Strategy\n\n### Immediate Notifications (Before 10:00 AM)\n**For steel-dependent urgent orders:**\n> \"Order [WO#] delivery may be impacted by a material quality issue from our primary supplier. We are expediting replacement material for Friday arrival and will update you by Friday noon with a confirmed delivery schedule.\"\n\n**For non-steel urgent orders:**\n> \"Order [WO#] remains on schedule. We are implementing extended production hours to ensure your Thursday/Friday delivery commitment.\"\n\n---\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Constraint Protection Measures\n1. **Pre-stage all materials** for Friday steel orders during Wed-Thu downtime\n2. **Assign best operator** to laser during critical recovery periods\n3. **Maintenance standby** during extended shifts (degraded laser more failure-prone)\n\n### Delivery Risk Assessment\n**Highest Risk Scenario:** If more than 3 of the 8 urgent orders are steel-dependent\n- **Mitigation:** Subcontracting assessment for 1-2 steel orders to qualified external laser shop\n- **Cost threshold:** Subcontracting cost < penalty cost for late delivery\n\n### Buffer Management\n- **Upstream operations:** Continue feeding the constraint queue despite material shortage\n- **Quality stations:** Expedite first-piece approval on steel orders Friday AM\n- **Shipping coordination:** Alert shipping supervisor to weekend packaging requirements if Saturday recovery needed\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics & Checkpoints\n\n### Wednesday 6:00 PM Checkpoint\n- **Target:** 12.4 constraint hours completed on urgent non-steel orders\n- **Status:** Green (on track) / Yellow (behind by <1 hour) / Red (behind by >1 hour)\n\n### Thursday 6:00 PM Checkpoint  \n- **Target:** All urgent non-steel orders complete, steel material arrived and verified\n- **Preparation:** Steel orders queued and staged for Friday start\n\n### Friday Noon Assessment\n- **Constraint recovery rate:** Are we closing the gap or falling further behind?\n- **Customer update:** Firm delivery dates for all 8 urgent orders\n\n---\n\n## Escalation Triggers\n\n**Immediate Management Notification Required:**\n- Any of the 8 urgent orders will definitively miss customer commitments\n- Laser degradation worsens below 80% (total failure risk)\n- Friday steel delivery is delayed beyond 10:00 AM\n\n**Resource Authorization Needed:**\n- Saturday overtime approval (if recovery is behind schedule Friday PM)\n- Subcontracting approval (if internal recovery impossible)\n- Premium freight for expedited steel delivery (if standard Friday delivery at risk)\n\n---\n\n## Post-Crisis Actions (Next Week)\n\n1. **Single-point-of-failure analysis:** 2 operators out of 5 creating constraint failure\n2. **Cross-training acceleration:** Qualify 2 additional operators on laser cutting\n3. **Dual sourcing review:** Steel supplier qualification to prevent future material delays\n4. **Preventive maintenance:** Resonator replacement schedule to prevent recurrence\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** We can recover from this triple disruption, but only with disciplined execution of the constraint protection strategy. The 32% capacity reduction is severe but not fatal if we eliminate all waste and run the constraint continuously through the recovery period.",

      "agent_response": "## Phased Transition Plan — Comfort Systems Manufacturing\n\n### Executive Summary\n\n**Recommended Approach:** 4-phase transition beginning August 19, with staggered mould changes across 3 weeks. This maintains 91% summer production capacity through August 18, provides a controlled ramp to full winter production by September 9, and delivers required winter inventory by September 15 with 2 days margin.\n\n### Phase Schedule Overview\n\n| Phase | Dates | Summer Machines | Winter Machines | Summer Daily Rate | Winter Daily Rate |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Phase 1** | Aug 1–18 | 6 | 0 | 3,200 units | 0 |\n| **Phase 2** | Aug 19–25 | 4 | 2 | 2,133 units | 1,100 units |\n| **Phase 3** | Aug 26–Sep 1 | 2 | 4 | 1,067 units | 2,200 units |\n| **Phase 4** | Sep 2–15 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 3,300 units |\n\n### Detailed Phase Implementation\n\n#### Phase 1: Summer Production Focus (Aug 1–18)\n- **Duration:** 18 working days\n- **All 6 machines on summer products** (maintaining 91% utilisation)\n- **Production target:** 3,200 units/day × 18 days = **57,600 units**\n- **Summer backlog impact:** Reduces 45,000 remaining to zero, creates 12,600 units safety buffer\n\n**Rationale:** Build safety stock before transition begins. The 12,600-unit buffer protects against transition-period disruptions and provides flexibility for end-of-August retailer rush orders.\n\n#### Phase 2: First Transition (Aug 19–25)\n- **Duration:** 5 working days (includes weekend for mould changes)\n- **Mould changes:** Machines #5 and #6 transition to winter (Friday Aug 18 PM)\n- **Configuration:** 4 summer machines, 2 winter machines\n\n**Summer Production:**\n- Daily rate: 4 machines × 533 units/machine = **2,133 units/day**\n- 5-day production: **10,665 units**\n- Cumulative summer total: **68,265 units** (exceeds 45,000 target by 51%)\n\n**Winter Production:**\n- Daily rate: 2 machines × 550 units/machine = **1,100 units/day**\n- 5-day production: **5,500 units**\n- Begin building winter inventory buffer\n\n#### Phase 3: Second Transition (Aug 26–Sep 1)\n- **Duration:** 5 working days\n- **Mould changes:** Machines #3 and #4 transition (Friday Aug 25 PM)\n- **Configuration:** 2 summer machines, 4 winter machines\n\n**Summer Production:**\n- Daily rate: 2 machines × 533 units/machine = **1,067 units/day**\n- 5-day production: **5,335 units**\n- **Total summer production:** **73,600 units** (164% of backlog requirement)\n\n**Winter Production:**\n- Daily rate: 4 machines × 550 units/machine = **2,200 units/day**\n- 5-day production: **11,000 units**\n- Cumulative winter: **16,500 units** (66% of Sep 15 target)\n\n#### Phase 4: Full Winter Production (Sep 2–15)\n- **Duration:** 10 working days\n- **Mould changes:** Machines #1 and #2 transition (Friday Sep 1 PM)\n- **Configuration:** 0 summer machines, 6 winter machines\n\n**Winter Production:**\n- Daily rate: 6 machines × 550 units/machine = **3,300 units/day**\n- 10-day production: **33,000 units**\n- **Total winter inventory by Sep 15:** 16,500 + 33,000 = **49,500 units**\n- **Exceeds 25,000 target by 98%** — provides substantial buffer for September shipments\n\n### Mould Change Schedule\n\n| Machine Pair | Transition Date | Downtime Window | Technician Assignment |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Machines #5, #6** | Friday Aug 18, 4:00 PM | Aug 18 PM – Aug 19 AM | Both technicians (parallel work) |\n| **Machines #3, #4** | Friday Aug 25, 4:00 PM | Aug 25 PM – Aug 26 AM | Both technicians (parallel work) |\n| **Machines #1, #2** | Friday Sep 1, 4:00 PM | Sep 1 PM – Sep 2 AM | Both technicians (parallel work) |\n\n**Timeline per mould change:**\n- 4:00 PM: Day shift ends, begin mould extraction\n- 4:00–6:00 PM: Extract summer moulds from both machines\n- 6:00–8:00 PM: Install winter moulds\n- 8:00–9:00 PM: First-piece qualification and dimensional verification\n- 9:00 PM: Machines ready for Monday morning production\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategies\n\n#### Summer Production Risk\n- **12,600-unit safety buffer** built in Phase 1 absorbs any transition disruption\n- Summer orders 164% filled by Aug 31 — substantial margin for late orders\n- Maintain 2 summer machines through Aug 31 for any emergency retailer requests\n\n#### Winter Production Risk\n- **24,500-unit surplus** above the 25,000 Sep 15 requirement\n- Winter production begins Aug 19 (27 days before first shipment due)\n- Full winter capacity operational by Sep 2 (13 days before shipment deadline)\n\n#### Transition Execution Risk\n- **Friday PM mould changes** minimize production day disruption\n- **2 technicians parallel work** reduces changeover time to 5 hours vs. 10 hours sequential\n- **3 transition points** spread risk across 3 weekends vs. single-event failure\n\n### Capacity Utilisation Analysis\n\n| Period | Available Hrs/Day | Scheduled Hrs/Day | Utilisation % |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Phase 1 (Summer only) | 96 | 87.4 | 91% |\n| Phase 2 (4+2 mixed) | 96 | 87.4 | 91% |\n| Phase 3 (2+4 mixed) | 96 | 87.4 | 91% |\n| Phase 4 (Winter only) | 96 | 90.0 | 94% |\n\n**Note:** Phase 4 utilisation increases to 94% because winter products have slightly different cycle times, but constraint remains protected below 95%.\n\n### Quality and First-Piece Verification\n\nEach mould change includes mandatory qualification protocol:\n1. **Dimensional verification** on first 3 pieces per machine\n2. **Colour match verification** against master standards\n3. **Surface finish inspection** for cosmetic grade parts\n4. **Production rate validation** to confirm 550 units/machine/day target\n\n**Quality hold buffer:** Each transition includes 1-hour qualification window. If first-piece fails, add 2-hour rework/adjustment buffer before releasing to production.\n\n### Customer Communication Plan\n\n#### Summer Customers (Retailers)\n- **Aug 15 notification:** \"All summer orders confirmed for on-time delivery by Aug 31. Current production 23% ahead of schedule.\"\n- **Aug 31 final confirmation:** \"Summer order completion certified. Excess inventory available for additional orders through Sep 15.\"\n\n#### Winter Customers (Early Season)\n- **Aug 1 notification:** \"Winter production begins Aug 19. Sep 15 delivery confirmed with 2x safety margin.\"\n- **Sep 10 shipment confirmation:** \"Winter inventory at 198% of commitment level. Ready for accelerated shipment if needed.\"\n\n### Contingency Plans\n\n#### If Mould Change Overruns (>5 hours)\n- **Buffer available:** Each transition occurs on Friday PM. If changeover extends to 8 hours, machines are still operational by Saturday AM.\n- **Saturday overtime authorized** to recover any lost production during overrun.\n\n#### If Summer Demand Increases\n- **Phase 2 extension option:** Delay Machines #3, #4 transition by 1 week if summer orders spike in late August.\n- **Trade-off quantified:** Each week of delay reduces winter buffer from 98% to 78% surplus — still comfortable.\n\n#### If Winter Demand Increases\n- **Acceleration option:** Move Phase 4 transition to Aug 29 (3 days early) to add 9,900 units winter inventory.\n- **Cost:** Sacrifice 3,200 summer safety buffer units — acceptable if winter demand confirmed.\n\n### Implementation Checklist\n\n**Week of Aug 12:**\n- [ ] Confirm tooling technician availability for all 3 transition weekends\n- [ ] Pre-stage winter moulds at Machines #5, #6\n- [ ] Verify winter raw material (ABS + color masterbatch) inventory\n- [ ] Brief quality team on first-piece qualification protocol\n\n**Friday Aug 18:**\n- [ ] Complete final summer production run on Machines #5, #6 by 4:00 PM\n- [ ] Begin mould extraction with both technicians\n- [ ] Update production schedule for Aug 19 mixed-mode operation\n\n**This plan delivers 164% of summer requirements and 198% of winter requirements while maintaining constraint protection throughout the transition period.**",

      "agent_response": "## Diagnosis: Systematic Routing Time Erosion at Constraint\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nYour schedule adherence decline from 92% to 78% is directly caused by systematic underestimation of operation times in the ERP routing data. The constraint (CNC milling cell) is consistently allocated insufficient time, creating a cascading delay that ripples through every downstream operation.\n\n**Impact Quantification:**\n- **Setup time variance:** 52% underestimate (25 min vs 38 min actual)\n- **Run time variance:** 14% underestimate (4.2 min vs 4.8 min per piece)\n- **Total job time variance:** 23% underestimate (3.5 hrs vs 4.3 hrs actual)\n\nAt the constraint, this means every scheduled job overruns by an average of 48 minutes (4.3 - 3.5 hours). With typical constraint scheduling at 85% utilisation, you're systematically planning for 102 hours/week when you actually need 125 hours/week — a 23% capacity gap that's impossible to close without addressing the root data problem.\n\n## Immediate Corrections Required\n\n### 1. Setup Time Correction (Priority 1 — Constraint Impact)\n\n**Current ERP Standard:** 25 minutes average\n**Actual Required:** 38 minutes average (+52%)\n\n**Segmented Correction by Job Complexity:**\n```\nSimple jobs (standard tooling, minimal fixtures): 28 minutes (12% increase)\nStandard jobs (moderate complexity): 38 minutes (52% increase) \nComplex jobs (new variants, custom fixtures): 55 minutes (120% increase)\n```\n\nThe 52% average masks significant variation. New product variants are driving the highest setup variances. Update ERP routing templates:\n- Legacy products: increase setup standards by 12%\n- Q2 new variants: increase setup standards by 80-120% based on actual complexity\n- Flag any job requiring >45 minutes setup for pre-shift tooling preparation\n\n### 2. Run Time Correction (Secondary Impact)\n\n**Current ERP Standard:** 4.2 min/piece\n**Actual Required:** 4.8 min/piece (+14%)\n\nThe 14% variance suggests tooling degradation — worn tools create longer cycle times due to reduced cutting speeds and additional spring passes. \n\n**Immediate Action:**\n- Increase all milling operation run times by 15% in ERP routing\n- Implement tool life tracking in MES — replace cutting tools at 80% of rated life instead of running to failure\n- Add 0.1 min/piece buffer for complex geometries (new variants typically have tighter tolerances requiring slower feeds)\n\n### 3. Total Job Time Impact\n\nThe 23% underestimate compounds across the entire job:\n- **Lost constraint capacity:** 23 hours/week at current load\n- **Schedule compression:** Every job pushes subsequent jobs later\n- **Buffer erosion:** Downstream work centres receive late material, consuming protective capacity\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Emergency Routing Updates (Week 1)\n\n**Monday:**\n1. Extract all active routings for CNC milling operations from ERP\n2. Apply blanket corrections:\n   - Setup times: +20% minimum, +60% for jobs flagged as \"complex\"\n   - Run times: +15% across all operations\n   - Add routing notes: \"Updated [date] for actual vs. standard analysis\"\n\n**Tuesday-Wednesday:**\n3. Re-run finite capacity scheduling with corrected times\n4. Identify capacity overloads — with accurate times, you may discover the constraint is loaded beyond 100%\n5. If overloaded: authorize Saturday overtime immediately or defer lowest-priority jobs\n\n**Thursday:**\n6. Publish revised schedules with realistic timing to all shift supervisors\n7. Communicate to shop floor: \"New timing standards are in effect. Jobs should now complete closer to scheduled end times.\"\n\n### Phase 2: Precision Calibration (Weeks 2-4)\n\n**Setup Time Granularity:**\nInstead of one average, create setup families:\n- **Family A (Simple):** Standard tooling, collets, minimal fixturing = 28 minutes\n- **Family B (Moderate):** Vise work, multiple tools, dial-in required = 38 minutes  \n- **Family C (Complex):** Custom fixtures, 5+ tools, precision setups = 55 minutes\n- **Family D (New Products):** First-time setups, unknown variables = 70 minutes + engineering support\n\n**Run Time Precision:**\nSeparate run time standards by:\n- Material type (aluminum: 4.2 min, steel: 4.8 min, stainless: 5.1 min)\n- Feature complexity (simple holes: 3.8 min, complex profiles: 5.2 min)\n- Tolerance class (±0.005\": standard rate, ±0.001\": +25% time)\n\n### Phase 3: Continuous Calibration Process\n\n**Weekly Routing Review:**\n1. **Every Monday:** MES report comparing planned vs. actual for previous week's jobs\n2. **Variance threshold:** Any operation with >15% time variance gets flagged for review\n3. **Monthly update cycle:** Adjust ERP routing standards based on rolling 4-week actual averages\n\n**Setup Technician Competency Recovery:**\nThe loss of experienced setup technicians is a permanent change. Routing standards must reflect current skill levels, not the capabilities of retired experts.\n\n- **Training acceleration:** Cross-train 2 additional operators on complex setups\n- **Standard work:** Document setup procedures for the 10 most complex jobs (these are driving your worst variances)\n- **Graduated complexity:** New setup technicians work Simple→Moderate→Complex job progression over 6 months\n\n## Process to Prevent Future Divergence\n\n### 1. Automated Variance Monitoring\n\n**MES Integration:**\nConfigure MES to automatically flag routing variances:\n- Setup variance >20% on any job triggers immediate review\n- 3 consecutive jobs with >10% variance triggers routing update\n- Monthly summary report shows systematic drift patterns\n\n### 2. Engineering Change Control\n\n**New Product Introduction Protocol:**\n- All new parts get provisional routing times +30% buffer for first 5 production runs\n- After 5 runs, calculate actual averages and update ERP routing permanently\n- No new part goes into standard production scheduling until routing times are validated\n\n### 3. Tooling Impact on Standards\n\n**Tool Life Integration:**\n- Track tool wear vs. cycle time degradation\n- When tool life drops below 80%, cycle times increase ~8-12%\n- Build tool replacement schedule into preventive maintenance\n- Update routing standards when tooling replacement intervals change\n\n## Expected Recovery Timeline\n\n**Week 1-2:** Schedule adherence improves to 85-87% with corrected routing times\n**Week 3-4:** Adherence reaches 90%+ as shop floor adjusts to realistic schedules  \n**Month 2:** Stable 92%+ adherence with calibrated routing standards\n**Month 3:** Preventive monitoring system prevents future degradation\n\n## Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\n**Cost of Inaction:**\n- 14% schedule adherence gap = late deliveries, expediting costs, customer complaints\n- Constraint capacity planning error = systematic overtime or missed commitments\n- Planning credibility erosion = shop floor stops trusting the schedule\n\n**Investment Required:**\n- Routing update effort: ~40 hours engineering time\n- MES variance reporting setup: ~20 hours IT configuration\n- Training for setup technicians: ~80 hours over 6 months\n\n**Payback:**\n- Schedule adherence recovery: 14% improvement = eliminated expediting costs (~$15K/month)\n- Constraint capacity accuracy: enables proper capacity planning and customer commitments\n- Planning credibility: shop floor follows schedules that reflect reality\n\nThe 23% routing time underestimate is not a minor data quality issue — it's a systematic scheduling failure that makes accurate capacity planning impossible. Fix the data first, then the scheduling performance will follow.",
