  "description": "Project workspace setup and documentation standard for OpenClaw agents. Enforces a three-layer documentation system and self-contained project structure. Triggers when: (1) starting a new project (new project, create project, 新项目, 开始项目), (2) organizing an existing workspace (clean up workspace, 整理项目, 规范目录), (3) creating project documentation (create project docs, 建项目文档). Ensures all project work stays within its own directory, temp files never pollute the workspace root, and documentation is always maintained alongside code.",
