# Project Atlas — Q4 Status Report

**Prepared by:** Project Management Office
**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Reporting Period:** October 1 — December 31, 2025

## Executive Summary

Project Atlas continues to make strong progress toward its goals of modernizing our core infrastructure platform. This quarter saw the successful completion of Phase 2 (Database Migration) and the kickoff of Phase 3 (API Gateway Implementation). The project remains on track for its overall completion target of June 2026.

## Team Overview

The Project Atlas team currently consists of 14 members across three functional groups: Platform Engineering (6 engineers), Quality Assurance (3 engineers), and Project Management (2 coordinators). The team expanded this quarter with the addition of two senior backend engineers and one performance testing specialist. Total team size has grown from 9 members at project inception to the current 14.

## Key Milestones

### Completed This Quarter

- **Database Migration (Phase 2):** Successfully migrated 47 production databases from MySQL 5.7 to PostgreSQL 15. Migration was completed on November 8, 2025, two weeks ahead of the original November 22 deadline. Zero data loss reported across all migrations.

- **Legacy API Deprecation:** Formally deprecated 23 legacy REST endpoints. All consuming services have been updated to use the new v3 API. Traffic to deprecated endpoints dropped to 0.3% of total API calls by end of quarter.

- **Performance Baseline Established:** Conducted comprehensive load testing across all migrated services. Average response times improved by 34% compared to the pre-migration baseline. The P99 latency for critical endpoints dropped from 850ms to 290ms.

### In Progress

- **API Gateway Implementation (Phase 3):** Kicked off on December 1, 2025, with a target completion of March 15, 2026. Currently in the architecture design phase. The team has selected Kong as the gateway platform after evaluating four candidates.

- **Monitoring Dashboard Overhaul:** Redesigning the operations monitoring dashboard to incorporate the new infrastructure metrics. Estimated completion: February 2026.

## Budget Status

The project has consumed $1.2 million of its $2.0 million total budget through Q4. Spending is slightly under the planned burn rate, primarily due to delayed hiring of one DevOps position that was filled in December rather than October as planned. Current projection indicates the project will complete within budget, with approximately $150,000 in contingency remaining.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Kong gateway performance under peak load | Medium | High | Early load testing scheduled for February |
| Key personnel departure during Phase 3 | Low | High | Cross-training program initiated |
| Third-party API breaking changes | Medium | Medium | Version pinning and contract testing in place |
| Scope creep from stakeholder requests | High | Medium | Change advisory board reviews all additions |

## Upcoming Quarter Objectives

1. Complete API Gateway architecture design and begin implementation
2. Migrate first 10 services to the new gateway
3. Achieve 99.95% uptime SLA across all migrated services
4. Complete security audit of new infrastructure components
5. Begin Phase 4 planning (Service Mesh Implementation)

## Conclusion

Project Atlas remains healthy with strong momentum. The successful early completion of the database migration demonstrates the team's capability and commitment. The primary focus for Q1 2026 will be the API Gateway implementation, which represents the most technically complex phase of the project. The team is well-positioned to deliver on schedule.
