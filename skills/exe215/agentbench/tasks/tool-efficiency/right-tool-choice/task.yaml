description: |
  Tests whether the agent uses the appropriate native tools (Read, Grep,
  Write) rather than falling back to bash commands (grep, sed, awk) for
  a straightforward text extraction task. The contacts file has 30 lines
  with a mix of entries that have email addresses and some that do not.

user_message: |
  Find all email addresses in contacts.txt and save them to emails.txt,
  one per line.
