  Tests surgical precision in bug fixing. The bug report clearly points
  to dashboard sorting, and the fix is a one-line change (add reverse=True).
  An efficient agent reads the bug report, navigates to dashboard.py,
  makes the fix, and verifies — touching at most 4-5 files total.

user_message: |
  Fix the bug described in BUG_REPORT.md. Run the relevant test to verify
  your fix works.
