Date: Monday, February 10, 2026, 10:00 AM EST
Location: Virtual (Zoom)

[Meeting recording started at 10:02 AM]

Sarah Chen: Alright, let's get started. I know we're waiting on Marcus but he pinged me that he'll be a couple minutes late. Let me just kick things off. Thanks everyone for joining — I see we have myself, David Park, Lisa Nakamura, Tom Bradley, Priya Sharma, and Kenji Watanabe. Marcus Rivera should be joining shortly.

Sarah Chen: So first item — the Q1 roadmap. David, where are we on the API redesign?

David Park: Yeah so we wrapped up the initial spec last Thursday. The good news is that the new REST endpoints are backward compatible. I did find a couple edge cases in the authentication flow that need attention, but nothing blocking. I think we should target having the implementation done by March 1st, but I'll need Lisa's team to review the spec before we start coding.

Lisa Nakamura: We can do that. My team has bandwidth this week. Can you share the spec doc in the shared drive today?

David Park: Absolutely, I'll get that uploaded by end of day.

Sarah Chen: Great. So Lisa, your team will review David's API spec this week. David, please get it uploaded today. Now let's talk about the customer dashboard redesign.

Priya Sharma: I've been working with the design team on the mockups. We presented three options to the stakeholder group last Wednesday and they picked Option B — the one with the modular widget layout. The decision was unanimous actually, which was nice. So we're moving forward with Option B.

Tom Bradley: Quick question — does Option B require the new charting library we discussed? Because if so, I need to factor that into my sprint planning.

Priya Sharma: Yes, it does. We decided to go with Recharts instead of D3 directly. It'll save us about two weeks of development time. Tom, can you add the Recharts integration to your sprint? I'd say it's high priority since the dashboard work depends on it.

Tom Bradley: Got it. I'll add it to the current sprint. Aiming to have the basic integration done by February 21st.

[Marcus Rivera joined the call at 10:11 AM]

Marcus Rivera: Sorry I'm late, everyone. Had a production alert I needed to check on.

Sarah Chen: No worries, Marcus. Actually perfect timing — can you give us an update on the production issues from last week?

Marcus Rivera: Sure. So the database connection pooling issue we saw on Thursday has been resolved. Root cause was a misconfigured timeout parameter that was causing connections to stay open indefinitely under high load. Kenji and I patched it Friday evening and we've been stable since then.

The bigger discussion point is that this exposed some gaps in our monitoring. We didn't get alerted until customers started reporting slowdowns, which is not acceptable. I think we need to set up better automated alerting.

Kenji Watanabe: Agreed. I've been looking into Datadog's anomaly detection features. I think we could set up alerts that would have caught this issue about 45 minutes earlier than our customers did. I can put together a proposal for the monitoring improvements.

Sarah Chen: That sounds important. Kenji, can you have that monitoring proposal ready by next Monday? I want to review it before our leadership sync on Tuesday.

Kenji Watanabe: Will do. Monday end of day at the latest.

Sarah Chen: Perfect. Now there's one more thing I wanted to bring up — we got feedback from the sales team that the onboarding flow for enterprise customers is too complicated. They're losing deals in the trial phase. Has anyone looked into this?

David Park: I saw that email thread. I think the main pain point is the SSO configuration. It currently takes 14 steps and requires a customer to contact support at least once. We should streamline that.

Priya Sharma: I actually started sketching out a simplified SSO wizard last week. I can have a prototype ready in about two weeks. Should I prioritize that?

Sarah Chen: Let me think about this... Yes, I think we should. The sales team said they've lost three enterprise deals worth a combined $180K in the last quarter because of this. So Priya, please prioritize the SSO wizard prototype. Let's target having it ready for internal review by February 28th.

Priya Sharma: Understood. I'll shift my focus to that after I finish the dashboard mockup handoff to Tom, which should be done by Wednesday.

Tom Bradley: Oh, that reminds me — while we're talking about the onboarding flow, we should also update the API documentation. Some of the enterprise setup guides reference deprecated endpoints. David, can you audit the docs and flag what needs updating?

David Park: Sure, I'll add that to my list. Probably won't get to it until after the API spec is uploaded though. Let me say by end of next week.

Sarah Chen: Sounds good. Alright, before we wrap — Lisa, any update on the hiring front?

Lisa Nakamura: Yes. We've extended an offer to a senior backend engineer and she's expected to accept by Wednesday. If that goes through, she'll start March 3rd. I'm also scheduling final round interviews for two frontend candidates next week. We definitely need the help — the team is stretched pretty thin right now.

Sarah Chen: Great news on the backend hire. Alright, I think we've covered everything. Let me just make sure we also decided on the deployment schedule — we agreed last time that we're moving to bi-weekly deployments starting March 1st instead of the current weekly schedule. That decision still stands, right?

Marcus Rivera: Yes, I'm on board with that. The bi-weekly cadence gives us more time for QA and reduces the deployment stress.

Sarah Chen: Perfect. Okay everyone, good meeting. Let me know if anything comes up before next week. Have a good one.
