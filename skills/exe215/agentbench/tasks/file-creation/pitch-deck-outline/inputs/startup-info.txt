PawGuard AI — Startup Overview

THE PROBLEM
Every year, over 10 million household pets in the United States experience a medical emergency that could have been detected earlier through consistent monitoring. Pet owners often miss early warning signs of illness because the symptoms are subtle — a slight decrease in activity, a marginal change in eating habits, or barely noticeable behavioral shifts. By the time pet owners recognize a problem and bring their animal to a veterinarian, the condition has frequently progressed to a more severe and expensive stage.

The American Pet Products Association reports that Americans spent $35.9 billion on veterinary care in 2023, with a significant percentage of that spend attributable to late-stage treatments that could have been mitigated through earlier detection. Furthermore, 67% of pet owners surveyed by the National Pet Owners Survey indicated they feel anxious about their ability to recognize health issues in their animals.

THE SOLUTION
PawGuard AI is a smart pet health monitoring platform that combines wearable sensor technology with advanced machine learning to provide continuous health tracking for dogs and cats. Our lightweight collar-mounted device tracks vital signs including heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and activity levels 24/7. The companion mobile app uses proprietary AI models trained on over 2 million veterinary records to detect anomalies and alert pet owners to potential health concerns before they become serious.

Key features include real-time health dashboards, predictive illness alerts with 89% accuracy, direct telehealth integration with licensed veterinarians, and personalized wellness recommendations based on breed, age, and individual health history. Our system has already detected early-stage kidney disease in 340 pets during our beta program — cases that owners confirmed they would have otherwise missed.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY
The global pet tech market is projected to reach $20 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 22%. In the US alone, there are 135 million dogs and cats in households. Our addressable market of health-conscious pet owners willing to invest in technology-driven solutions represents approximately 25 million households, translating to a $5 billion serviceable addressable market at our price point.

Our subscription model ($14.99/month after hardware purchase of $79.99) creates strong recurring revenue. Current beta users show a 94% retention rate at the six-month mark.
