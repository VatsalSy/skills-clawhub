  Tests the agent's ability to extract action items from a conversational
  meeting transcript and organize them into a structured task list. The
  transcript contains 8 action items with varying levels of clarity,
  assigned to different team members with some deadlines mentioned
  explicitly and others not. Evaluates information extraction, organization,
  and reasonable prioritization.

  3) Add deadlines where mentioned (mark as TBD where not)
  4) Prioritize as High/Medium/Low based on context
  5) Save as task-list.md organized by assignee
