Product Team Sync — February 12, 2026
Participants: Alex Rivera (PM), Jordan Lee (Design Lead), Sam Patel (Backend), Mia Torres (Frontend), Chris Yang (QA), Dana Kim (Data), Raj Gupta (DevOps), Nina Okafor (Marketing)

Alex: Let's jump right in. We've got a lot to cover today. First up, the mobile app redesign. Jordan, where are we?

Jordan: So we finalized the design system updates last week. The new component library is ready for handoff. Mia, I'll need you to start implementing the updated navigation bar — it's the highest priority component since every screen depends on it. Can you have that done by February 21st?

Mia: That's tight but doable if I don't get pulled into other things. I'll make it happen.

Alex: Good, let's protect Mia's time on that. Now, Sam, the API performance issues we saw in production last week — what's the status?

Sam: I've been profiling the slow endpoints. The main culprit is the product search API — it's doing a full table scan on a 2 million row table. I need to add proper indexing and rewrite the query. Should take me about a week. The fix needs to go through Raj's deployment pipeline though.

Raj: I can handle that. Just let me know when the PR is ready and I'll fast-track it through staging. Actually, while we're talking about infrastructure, I need to migrate our CI/CD pipeline from Jenkins to GitHub Actions. It's been flaky and costing us hours every week. I'm going to start that migration this week and target completion by March 1st.

Alex: Sounds good. Just make sure you document the new pipeline so the team can self-serve. Speaking of documentation, Dana, can you put together the analytics requirements doc for the new dashboard? The stakeholders keep asking when we'll have real-time metrics.

Dana: Sure, I've actually started drafting it. I'll have the full requirements document ready by next Wednesday, February 19th. One thing though — I need access to the production analytics database to validate my assumptions. Can someone grant that?

Sam: I'll set up a read-only replica access for you. Should be done by tomorrow.

Alex: Perfect. Now the elephant in the room — the security audit findings. We got the report back yesterday and there are three critical items. Chris, I need you to write up test cases for all the security fixes so we can verify them before the March release. Can you prioritize that?

Chris: Absolutely. I'll need the detailed findings report from the security team though. Once I have that, I can have the test cases ready in about 10 days. So if I get the report today, that's February 22nd.

Alex: I'll forward you the report right after this meeting. Nina, on the marketing side — we're planning to announce the redesigned app at the end of March. Can you start preparing the launch materials?

Nina: I was actually going to bring that up. I need final screenshots of the new UI to build the press kit and social media assets. Jordan, when do you think I can get those?

Jordan: The full UI mockups will be finalized by February 28th. You can use those for the marketing materials even before the engineering implementation is complete.

Nina: Perfect. I'll plan to have the full launch campaign ready by March 15th then. That gives me two weeks after getting the mockups.

Alex: Great. One more thing — Mia, after you finish the navigation bar, I need you to also look into the accessibility audit results. We have 12 WCAG violations that need fixing before launch. Not urgent this second, but start planning for it.

Mia: Got it. I'll review the accessibility report after the nav bar is done and put together a remediation plan.

Sam: Oh, before I forget — the database backup automation script has been failing silently for the past two weeks. I discovered it yesterday when I was doing the performance profiling. Raj, can you look into why the cron job is failing? This is pretty critical since we have no recent automated backups.

Raj: That is critical. I'll investigate that today and fix it. This takes priority over the CI/CD migration.

Alex: Agreed. Let's make sure backups are working before anything else. Alright team, good sync. Let me summarize the key deadlines we discussed and we'll regroup next week. Everyone knows what they're doing. Thanks all!
