# awesome-claude-skills

## Purpose
A large collection of reusable Claude skill templates (design, marketing, dev, automation). We treat it as a library we can import patterns from.

## Installed source
- Repo: https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills
- Local clone: `workspace/skills_external/ComposioHQ_awesome-claude-skills` @ `2790447`

## Use when
- You need a quick starting point for a new role/mission (brand guidelines, ads extractor, changelog generator, etc.)
- You want best-practice structure for a skill folder

## Notes
We do not automatically execute external scripts inside this repo. We only copy/translate patterns into our workspace skills.
