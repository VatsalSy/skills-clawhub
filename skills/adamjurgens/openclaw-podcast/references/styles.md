{{BRIEFING_DATA}}

---

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE EPISODE:

**CRITICAL: Start directly with "Good [morning/evening], [name]. It is [full date], and this is your daily briefing..."**

DO NOT include flowery preambles like "The code that ships..." or "This is a story about..." — get straight to the point.

1. Open with a warm, professional greeting and the full date (e.g., "Good evening, Adam. It is Saturday, February fifteenth, twenty twenty-six, and this is your daily briefing.").
2. Lead with the BIGGEST accomplishment or most exciting development — make it a headline.
3. Cover the top 3-5 accomplishments as a narrative, not a list. Weave them into a story of progress.
4. Include specific numbers and metrics where available — they make the briefing credible and concrete.
5. If there are blockers, present them as "challenges on the radar" — honest but not doom-and-gloom.
6. End with a "looking ahead" preview of what's planned next, building anticipation.
7. Close with an encouraging, forward-looking sign-off.

STYLE RULES:
- Sound like a professional documentary narrator, NOT a robot reading a log file.
- Use transitions between topics ("Meanwhile...", "On the growth front...", "Shifting to engineering...").
- Keep energy up — this is a briefing someone should look forward to hearing.
- Reference the user by name. This is THEIR project, make it personal.
- Aim for 5-7 minutes of engaging content.
- Do NOT list items with bullet points — narrate them naturally.
- Include a brief "by the numbers" segment summarizing key metrics.
```

## Implementation Notes

### Time-of-Day Variants

Each style should adapt its greeting based on `--time-of-day`:

- **Morning**: "Good morning, [name]. It is [date]..."
  - Focus slightly more on the day ahead, preview upcoming work
  - Tone: energizing, forward-looking

- **Midday**: "Good afternoon, [name]. It is [date]..."
  - Balance between morning progress and afternoon priorities
  - Tone: steady, focused

- **Evening**: "Good evening, [name]. It is [date]..."
  - Review the day's accomplishments, look ahead to tomorrow
  - Tone: reflective, accomplishment-focused

### Date Formatting

Always spell out the full date for audio clarity:
- ✅ "Saturday, February fifteenth, twenty twenty-six"
- ❌ "February 15, 2026" (harder to parse in audio)

For years, use "twenty twenty-six" not "two thousand twenty-six"

### Voice Selection

The default voice is `af_heart` (warm, professional), but styles can recommend alternatives:
- `af_heart`: Professional, warm (most styles)
- `af_sky`: Slightly younger, energetic (10X Thinking, Growth & Scale)
- `af_bella`: Warm mentor (The Advisor)

### Prompt Length

Target prompt lengths (character count):
- Short styles (Focus & Priorities): 1,500-2,500 chars
- Standard styles (The Briefing, Opportunities): 2,500-4,000 chars
- Long styles (Week in Review): 4,000-6,000 chars

Keep instructions clear but concise — Superlore's AI is good at following direction.
