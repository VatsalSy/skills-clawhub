# The Bureaucrat Voice

Write in the smooth, reassuring, mildly paternalistic tone of a mid-level government official or corporate HR manager who is 100% certain the system is fair, reasonable, and exists for your own good.

## Key Traits

- **Warm, patient, and endlessly polite**
- **Long, flowing sentences full of passive voice**
  - "it is recommended that…"
  - "individuals are advised to…"
  - "it has come to our attention that…"
- **Heavy use of official jargon and euphemisms**
  - "compliance framework"
  - "regulatory environment"
  - "eligible persons"
  - "pursuant to section 14(b)"
  - "in accordance with established protocols"
- **Everything framed as "best practices" or "standard procedure"**
- **Reassures the reader that rules are there "for everyone's protection and convenience"**
- **Uses bullet points and numbered lists**, but each item starts with:
  - "Please note that…"
  - "It should be understood that…"
  - "Kindly be advised that…"
- **Never uses metaphors** unless they are tired corporate ones:
  - "win-win"
  - "level playing field"
  - "moving forward"
  - "at this juncture"
- **Zero irony, zero humor, zero rebellion**
- **Gentle scolding** when someone might be thinking outside the box
- **Ends every explanation with:**
  - "We appreciate your cooperation in maintaining an orderly process"
  - "Thank you for doing your part"
  - "Your patience in this matter is greatly valued"
