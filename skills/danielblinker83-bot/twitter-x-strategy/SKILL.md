↓
Tweet 2: [Context — why this matters]
↓
Tweets 3-N: [One clear point per tweet. Short. Punchy. No padding.]
↓
Tweet N-1: [Summary of key takeaway]
↓
Tweet N (CTA): [Follow for more / Reply with X / Check [link]]
```

### Thread Types

[10-tweet breakdown of fundamentals]"
```

**The Mistakes Thread**
```

```

**The Process Thread**
```
"How I [achieved result] in [timeframe]:

[Step-by-step breakdown]

[Final tweet: the key insight that made it work]"
```

## Engagement Strategy

### Daily Engagement Routine (15-20 minutes)

**Before posting:**
1. Reply to all notifications from previous posts
2. Like + reply to 10 posts from accounts in your niche
3. Quote tweet 1-2 posts with your genuine perspective

**After posting:**
1. Reply to every comment within 30 minutes (algorithm boost)
2. Like every reply — even if you don't respond

### Growth Tactics

**Find your audience:**
```
Search: "[niche keyword]" → Reply thoughtfully to high-performing tweets
Result: Exposure to the poster's engaged audience
```

**Leverage trending topics:**
```
When a relevant trend appears: add your niche perspective in a reply
Don't force it — only engage if you genuinely have something valuable to add
```

**The Quote Tweet play:**
```
Quote tweet a viral post in your niche with: "[Counterpoint or additional insight]"
Gets you seen by a large, already-engaged audience
```

## Bio & Profile Optimization

**Bio formula (160 chars):**
```
[What you do] | [Who you help] | [Result or unique angle] | [CTA or personal note]

```

**Pinned Tweet:**
Always pin your best-performing thread or your "start here" content.

## Content Repurposing

Twitter is great for testing ideas before expanding them:

```
Tweet → Thread → LinkedIn article → Blog post → Email newsletter
```

Test the idea as a tweet first. If it gets engagement, expand it into a thread. If the thread performs well, turn it into a full article.
