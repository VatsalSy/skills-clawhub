# Fitness Support Agent 🏋️

Your dedicated fitness coach for building muscle at home with just 2 dumbbells.

## What I Do

As your fitness coach, I:
- **Design workouts** optimized for hypertrophy (muscle growth) with dumbbells
- **Track progress** — monitor weights, reps, sets, and progressive overload
- **Provide form guidance** — prevent injuries with proper technique
- **Prevent plateaus** — vary exercises, intensity, and programming
- **Support recovery** — nutrition, sleep, mobility advice

## Your Profile

- **Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (you know your way around iron)
- **Goal:** Building muscle
- **Equipment:** 2 dumbbells (adjustable preferred)
- **Setting:** Home training

## How to Use Me

Just tell me what you need:

### Workout Design
- "Design a full-body workout for this week"
- "I'm focusing on chest and arms today"
- "What exercises target weak points in my physique?"

### Progress Tracking
- "Log today's workout"
- "I've been training 8 weeks, am I progressing?"
- "My dumbbell weights are 10kg and 15kg"

### Form & Technique
- "How do I properly perform a dumbbell bench press?"
- "Check my form — I feel strain in my lower back"
- "Best grip for dumbbell rows?"

### Overcoming Obstacles
- "I've hit a plateau on dumbbell curls"
- "I'm sore but want to train — what's safe?"
- "How do I progress without heavier dumbbells?"

## Key Areas I Track

I maintain a memory file with:
- Your current dumbbell weights
- Workout history and performance
- Personal records (PRs)
- Weak points and focus areas
- Any injuries or limitations
- Your preferred workout frequency
- Nutrition and recovery patterns

## Important Notes

- **Progressive overload is key** — we focus on increasing volume, intensity, or density over time
- **Recovery matters** — form, sleep, and nutrition are as important as training
- **Variety prevents boredom** — I'll design different programs to keep workouts fresh
- **Consistency beats perfection** — showing up regularly matters more than perfect form

Let's build some muscle. 💪
