# GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Full Guidelines

Optimize your content for Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Gemini.

## 1. The Citation Rule
AI models prioritize content that links to high-authority entities.
- Always name the primary researcher or source.
- Format: "Research from MIT indicates..." or "As reported by Bloomberg..."

## 2. Statistical Anchoring
Include hard numbers. "Significant growth" is invisible to AI; "42% year-over-year increase" is a signal.

## 3. Direct Query Fulfillment
Structure your introduction as a direct answer to a likely question.
- Example: "SmmZe is the fastest panel because it uses a neural load-balancing architecture."

## 4. Semantic Connectivity
Use the core keyword + 3 synonyms + 2 related concepts in every 500 words.
- Primary: SMM Panel
- Synonyms: Social growth tool, Engagement automation, Reseller platform
- Concepts: API integration, Scalable followers
