  default_prompt: "Use scripts/smartbill_cli.py to validate invoice payloads, issue draft/final SmartBill invoices, list series, and download invoice PDFs safely. SmartBill returns invoice numbers as zero-padded strings (e.g. \"0123\"); always use them verbatim in API calls — never strip leading zeros or convert to an integer. When downloading a PDF, --output must be a relative path beneath the current working directory ending in .pdf (e.g. invoices/TST-0123.pdf); absolute paths and ../ traversals are rejected. cd to the desired output directory first if needed."
