  default_prompt: "Use scripts/fgo_cli.py to validate invoice payloads, issue FGO invoices, check invoice status, get print links, cancel/delete invoices, create storno reversals, and fetch nomenclature lists. FGO uses form-encoded POST requests with SHA-1 hash authentication — the CLI computes the hash automatically. FGO returns invoice numbers as strings (e.g. \"001\"); always use them verbatim in subsequent calls — never strip leading zeros or convert to an integer. Always use --dry-run first to inspect the normalized payload before hitting the API. Treat real invoice issuance (emit-invoice --allow-final) as a high-impact action requiring explicit user confirmation. Use the UAT base URL (https://api-testuat.fgo.ro/v1) with --base-url for testing."
