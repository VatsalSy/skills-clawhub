## 📊 Complete Features Explained

### **1. Kelly Criterion Position Sizing**

**What it does:**
Calculates optimal position size based on your actual win rate and average win/loss.

**Example:**
```
Your stats:
- Win rate: 85%
- Avg win: +0.3%
- Avg loss: -0.5%

Kelly calculation:
kelly = (0.85 × 0.003 - 0.15 × 0.005) / 0.003 = 0.60

Position size = 60% × 50% (conservative) × signal_confidence
              = 30% × confidence

If winning streak:
- Win rate increases to 90%
- Kelly increases to 70%
- Position size grows to 35%

If losing streak:
- Win rate drops to 75%
- Kelly decreases to 40%
- Position size reduces to 20%
```

**Benefit:** Automatically adapts to your performance!

---

### **2. Trailing Stops**

**What it does:**
Moves stop loss up as profit increases, locking in gains.

**Example:**
```
Entry: $45,000
Initial SL: $44,775 (-0.5%)

Price: $45,450 (+1%)
→ Trailing SL: $45,000 (breakeven)

Price: $45,900 (+2%)
→ Trailing SL: $45,450 (lock +1%)

Price: $46,350 (+3%)
→ Trailing SL: $45,900 (lock +2%)

Price drops to $45,950
→ Sold at $45,900 (locked +2%)
```

**Without trailing:**
- Fixed TP at +0.3% = $45,135
- Missed extra +$765 profit!

**With trailing:**
- Captured +2% = $45,900
- Extra $765 profit secured ✅

---

### **3. Circuit Breakers (4 Levels)**

```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

    "stat_arb": 0.05     # 5% statistical arbitrage
}
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Kelly sizing too small"**

**Cause:** Low win rate or small avg win

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check performance
cat /workspace/performance_metrics.json

# If win_rate < 75%, bot is learning
# It will increase sizes as performance improves
```

---

### **"Circuit breaker activated"**

**Normal!** This protects your capital.

**Actions:**
1. Check Telegram alert for reason
2. Review daily report
3. Wait for auto-resume OR
4. Manually restart if kill switch

---

### **"No trades executed"**

**Possible reasons:**
- Market conditions (low volatility)
- Risk limits hit (circuit breaker active)
- No valid signals (OBI thresholds)

**Check:**
```bash
# View logs
tail -f executor.log

# Check portfolio state
cat /workspace/portfolio_state.json
```
