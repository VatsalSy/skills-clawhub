# Dynamic Adjustment Logic

This module adjusts strategy based on engagement signals.

# Engagement Indicators

Monitor:

- Comment volume
- Question frequency
- Price-related inquiries
- Interaction rate trend

# Adjustment Rules

If engagement drops:
- Reduce marketing intensity
- Increase question-based posts

If many price questions:
- Provide structured value clarification
- Reduce direct promotion

If technical questions dominate:
- Increase technical breakdown posts

If trend breakout detected:
- Prioritize industry content

# Stability Priority

Never increase both:
- Marketing intensity
- Posting frequency

At the same time.

Adjust gradually.
