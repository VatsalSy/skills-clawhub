# Paths (relative to sync repo root) to ignore during secret scanning.
# Use with care: ignored paths can contain real secrets and will not block sync.
#
# Rules:
# - One path per line
# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Trailing slash means "directory prefix" (ignore everything under it)
# - Otherwise, exact file path match
