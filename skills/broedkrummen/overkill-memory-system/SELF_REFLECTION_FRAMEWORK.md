# Framework Analysis: Self-Reflection + Self-Improving

## Overview

Analyze self-reflection skill and compare with self-improving to check for overlaps.

---

## self-reflection

### What It Does
- Agent self-reflection after tasks
- Review own performance
- Identify improvements
- Learn from outcomes

### Features
- Post-task reflection
- Performance review
- Learning extraction
- Goal assessment

---

## self-improving (Already Integrated)

### What It Does
- Log errors from failures
- Capture user corrections
- Track feature requests
- Record best practices

### Features
- ERROR logging
- Correction capture
- Feature requests
- Best practice tracking

---

## Comparison

| Aspect | self-reflection | self-improving | Overlap |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Trigger** | After task | On error/correction | Low |
| **Focus** | Performance review | Knowledge capture | Medium |
| **Output** | Reflection notes | Log entries | None |
| **Automation** | Periodic | Event-based | None |

---

## Overlap Analysis

### Minimal Overlap!
- self-reflection = **periodic** self-review
- self-improving = **event-based** capture

They serve different purposes:
- self-reflection: "How did I do?"
- self-improving: "What went wrong?"

---

## Recommendation

### Keep Both!

| Skill | Purpose | Frequency |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| self-improving | Event-driven (errors, corrections) | As needed |
| self-reflection | Periodic self-review | Daily/weekly |

### Integration
self-reflection could use self-improving logs as input for deeper reflection.

---

## Implementation (If Added)

```python
class SelfReflector:
    def reflect(self, task, outcome):
        """Reflect on task completion"""
        # What went well?
        # What could improve?
        # Lessons learned?
    
    def daily_reflection(self):
        """Daily self-review"""
        # Review today's interactions
        # Identify patterns
        # Set tomorrow's focus
```

---

## Conclusion

**No significant overlap** - different purposes. Could add self-reflection as complementary to self-improving.
