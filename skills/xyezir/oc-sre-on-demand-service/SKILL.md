# OC SRE On-Demand Service

## Service scope
- Gateway and node health checks
- Pairing/connectivity incident response
- Execution-path stabilization
- Security and configuration optimization

## Engagement model
1. Intake: issue summary and target environment.
2. Diagnosis: evidence-first checks and hypothesis.
3. Remediation: smallest safe fix first.
4. Verification: before/after proofs.
5. Handoff: actionable next steps.

## Output contract
- findings
- actions taken
- verification
- residual risk
- recommended roadmap

## Data handling
- external-facing reports must be fully sanitized.
- use placeholders for endpoints, infra, and identities.
