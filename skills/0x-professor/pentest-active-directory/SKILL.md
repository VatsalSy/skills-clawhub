# Pentest Active Directory

## Stage

- PTES: 6
- MITRE: TA0006, TA0008

## Objective

Map and validate AD privilege escalation and movement paths.

## Required Workflow

1. Validate scope before any active action and reject out-of-scope targets.
2. Run only authorized checks aligned to PTES, OWASP WSTG, NIST SP 800-115, and MITRE ATT&CK.
3. Write findings in canonical finding_schema format with reproducible PoC notes.
4. Honor dry-run mode and require explicit --i-have-authorization for live execution.
5. Export deterministic artifacts for downstream skill consumption.

## Execution

```bash
python skills/pentest-active-directory/scripts/active_directory.py --scope scope.json --target <target> --input <path> --output <path> --format json --dry-run
```

## Outputs

- `ad-findings.json`
- `ad-attack-paths.json`
- `ad-report.json`
