# LinkedIn Post Formats (Generic)

## A) "This runs now" format

Use when sharing automation systems.

- Claim
- Not demo / actual responsibility
- 4-6 concrete capabilities
- measurable result
- perspective + CTA

Example CTA:
- "Would this workflow help in your team?"
- "Want the exact template/ruleset?"

## B) Teardown format

Use when analyzing tools, prompts, or workflows.

- Context
- What failed
- What changed
- What now works
- reusable principle

## C) Build-in-public format

Use when sharing weekly progress.

- This week I built
- What worked
- What broke
- Next iteration
- ask for feedback

## D) Framework format

Use when teaching repeatable process.

- Name the framework
- Step 1-4 with one line each
- where people get stuck
- one practical exercise

## E) Comment bait (high quality)

Avoid generic "thoughts?"
Prefer:
- "Would you use this in your team? Why/why not?"
- "If you want the checklist, comment 'template'."
- "What would you automate first?"
