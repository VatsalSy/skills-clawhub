# Checklists

## A) In-Person Used Gear Inspection

- Confirm model and serial number match listing
- Check all drivers/tweeters for dents/rub/noise
- Sweep volume slowly for scratchy pots or relay dropouts
- Test every input/output used in your setup
- Inspect terminals, RCA/XLR jacks, HDMI/USB ports for looseness
- Verify remote, feet/spikes, grills, jumpers, original box/accessories
- Ask for service history and proof (invoice/photo)

## B) Shipping Risk Checklist

- Require double box for speakers/heavy amps
- Corner protection + immobilized internal foam
- Remove or secure tubes/fragile parts separately
- Confirm declared value and insurance
- Ask for pre-pack and post-pack photos

## C) First-Day Setup Checklist

- Power path and grounding checked
- Correct channel and polarity confirmed
- Safe gain staging (source -> pre -> power)
- Initial placement measured and recorded
- Listening baseline captured before EQ

## D) Quick Troubleshooting

### Hum/buzz
- Isolate source devices one by one
- Test single power strip path
- Lift/restore USB and TV connections to locate loop source

### Harsh highs
- Reduce toe-in
- Add soft furnishings/first reflection treatment
- Re-check DAC filter or aggressive EQ

### Weak center image
- Re-check equal distance and level matching
- Verify phase/polarity consistency
- Reduce asymmetry around speaker boundaries

### Boomy bass
- Move speakers/sub away from walls incrementally
- Adjust sub crossover lower and re-check phase
- Apply narrow EQ cuts only after placement fixes
