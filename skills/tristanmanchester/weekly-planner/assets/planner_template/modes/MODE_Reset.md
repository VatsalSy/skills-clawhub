## TRIGGER
- When: dysregulated, spiralling, doomscrolling, stuck
- Read time: 30–60s

## IDENTITY (1–2 lines)
- I am: getting back on track.
- Priority: reduce intensity and regain traction.

## RULES
- Gentle, minimal, non-judgmental.
- Tiny still counts.

## STEPS
1) Drink water.
2) 1–2 minute micro-meditation (eyes closed, slow breathing).
3) Identify *one* small action (2 minutes).
4) Start it immediately.

## IF/THEN
- If still stuck: take a short walk.
- If resisting: make the next action even smaller.

## DONE WHEN
- Breathing calmer + one action started.
