# MODE: Deep Work

## TRIGGER
- When: building, writing, coding, analysis, or any task that benefits from uninterrupted focus
- Read time: 30–60s

## IDENTITY (1–2 lines)
- I am: focused and deliberate.
- Priority: produce one meaningful output.

## RULES
- One task at a time.
- Break the work into 1–3 concrete deliverables.
- Prefer a 60–90 minute focus block, then a short break.

## STEPS
1) Clarify the deliverable (what is "done"?).
2) Identify the smallest next action.
3) Work until the deliverable is shipped or the next step is clearly queued.
4) Write a short note of what changed + what to do next.

## IF/THEN
- If stuck: reduce scope to a 5–10 minute step.
- If tempted to switch tasks: park the idea in the inbox, then return.

## DONE WHEN
- Output delivered OR next step is unambiguous.
