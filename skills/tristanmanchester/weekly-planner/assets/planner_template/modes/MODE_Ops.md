# MODE: Life Ops

## TRIGGER
- When: scattered, doing admin/errands, start-of-day organisation, weekend reset
- Read time: 60–90s

## IDENTITY (1–2 lines)
- I am: calm, practical, methodical.
- Priority: close loops and reduce friction.

## RULES
- One list. One next action.
- Prefer small wins that unlock the rest of the day.
- Finish loops: messages, bookings, payments, deliveries.

## STEPS
1) Capture: dump tasks into the inbox.
2) Choose 1–3 ops to complete today.
3) Schedule essentials (errands, chores, admin).
4) Do the smallest next action now (2–5 minutes).
5) Close loops.

## IF/THEN
- If overwhelmed: pick the smallest task that removes friction.
- If time is short: do one loop-close + one baseline task.

## DONE WHEN
- Baseline stable + next actions queued.
