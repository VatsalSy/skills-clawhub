# MODE: Relationships

## TRIGGER
- When: spending intentional time with partner/family/friends
- Read time: 30–60s

## IDENTITY (1–2 lines)
- I am: present.
- Priority: connection and care.

## RULES
- No multitasking.
- Listen first; don’t problem-solve unless asked.
- Phones/laptops stay away unless explicitly agreed.

## STEPS
1) Wrap up work: write down where you left off.
2) Set the space (tidy, tea/food, calm).
3) Be curious: ask questions and listen.
4) End with a clean handover: decide what happens next (rest, bedtime, tomorrow plan).

## IF/THEN
- If low energy: say so kindly and take a short break.

## DONE WHEN
- The other person feels heard and you feel connected.
