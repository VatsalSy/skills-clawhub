# Agents Refresh v1.1.1 💎                                                             
                                                                                          
   ## Overview                                                                            
   A skill for "distilling" AI agent memory.                                              
   Discarding the old idea of "deleting unnecessary info," it specializes in **extracting 
 valuable insights from noise**.                                                          
                                                                                          
   ## Installation                                                                        
   1. Install .skill from ClawHub or copy to workspace/skills/public/.                    
   2. `read skills/public/agents-refresh-md-en-v1.1.1/SKILL.md` to trigger.               
   3. Cron auto from manifest.yaml or manual `cron add` (copy from Quick Start).          
                                                                                          
   ## Usage                                                                               
   - **Auto:** 6AM cron reloads AGENTS/IDENTITY/SOUL + MEMORY distillation.               
   - **Manual:** `session_status` → edit HEARTBEAT.md → cron test run.                    
   - **Heartbeat:** 4h rotate (9AM/1PM/8PM) for long-session personality keep.            
                                                                                          
   ## Features                                                                            
   - 🐾 Gold Mining: Extract 4 Golds from logs (Confirmed/Pending/Lessons/Seeds).         
   - 📝 MEMORY template auto-output.                                                      
   - .md-only lightweight, no py, ClawHub-ready.                                          
                                                                                          
   ## v1.1.1 Updates                                                                      
   - **Creative Insight:** Improved to extract "idea seeds" and "lessons" from chats,     
 error logs, and trial/error processes, accumulating them in `MEMORY.md`.                 
   - **Three-Layer Memory Support:** Protects `IDENTITY.md` (immutable self) as a         
 sanctuary while flexibly updating `MEMORY.md`.                                           
   - **Security Normalization:** Compliant with ClawHub security guidelines, with         
 transparent file access permissions.                                                     
                                                                                          
   ## Developer's Vision                                                                  
   Chats and trial/error with AI are never wasted. By crystallizing them into "wisdom,"   
 the agent evolves daily into a companion that truly "understands you."                   
                                                                                          
   ## Developers
