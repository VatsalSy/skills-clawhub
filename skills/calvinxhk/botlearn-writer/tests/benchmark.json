Source: Netflix Tech Blog, 2016.\n- A 2023 InfoQ survey found 78% of organizations using microservices reported increased deployment frequency, but 65% reported increased operational complexity.\n- Martin Fowler warns about the 'microservices premium': the overhead is only justified at a certain scale. Source: martinfowler.com, 2015.\n- Amazon's two-pizza team rule emerged from their service-oriented architecture. Each team owns one service. Source: 'Working Backwards', 2021.\n- A 2024 DORA report found that elite performers using microservices deployed 973x more frequently than low performers, but the gap disappeared when controlling for team practices.\n- Kelsey Hightower tweeted: 'Monoliths are the future because the people who are currently building microservices will realize that most of their problems don't require microservices.'\n- Segment (analytics company) moved FROM microservices BACK to a monolith in 2018, citing excessive operational overhead for their team size. Source: Segment Engineering Blog.\n\nUsing this research material, write a 900-1100 word article for a CTO audience arguing whether startups should begin with a monolith or microservices.
