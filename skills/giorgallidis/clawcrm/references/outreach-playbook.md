# Outreach Playbook

## Principles

Cold email has 1-3% reply rates. Creative, value-first outreach gets 10-30%. The difference is relevance and giving before asking.

## High-ROI Outreach Approaches

### 1. Free Practice Audit (Highest ROI)
Use publicly available data to provide immediate value:
- Google Business profile (review count, rating, response rate)
- Website audit (mobile speed, SEO basics, online booking availability)
- Online presence score vs local competitors

**Template pattern:** "I looked at [Practice Name] — here are 3 things I noticed that are costing you patients: [specific findings]. Happy to show you how other [specialty] practices in [city] fixed these."

### 2. Reference-Based Social Proof
- "12 [specialty] practices in [state] switched to automated scheduling last quarter"
- Use real metrics from existing customers (anonymized if needed)
- City/specialty-specific comparisons

### 3. Trigger-Based Outreach
Send when something relevant happens:
- New Google review (good or bad) → "I saw your latest review..."
- Job posting for office manager → "Sounds like you're growing..."
- Website change detected → "Noticed you updated your site..."

### 4. Multi-Channel Sequences
Don't rely on email alone:
- Day 1: Personalized email with audit
- Day 3: LinkedIn connection request with note
- Day 7: Follow-up email with case study
- Day 14: Final email with specific ROI numbers

## Sender Identity

Data shows named senders get 20-40% higher open rates than generic addresses.

**Recommended pattern:** Use a specific name + role
- "Sarah Chen, Practice Growth @ [Company]"
- "Alex Rivera, Healthcare Solutions @ [Company]"

**Why it works:** People reply to people, not to info@ or hello@ addresses. A named sender with a role signals a real human who understands their domain.

**What to avoid:**
- hello@, info@, sales@, noreply@
- CEO/founder name (too senior for cold outreach, feels fake)
- Generic "The Team at..."

## Subject Lines That Work

- Specific > generic: "Your Google rating vs 3 competitors in [city]" beats "Grow your practice"
- Questions > statements: "Is [Practice Name] still using paper intake forms?"
- Short: 4-7 words optimal for mobile
- No spam triggers: avoid "free", "limited time", excessive caps/punctuation

## Personalization Checklist

Every outreach email must reference at least 2 of:
- [ ] Practice name and specialty
- [ ] City/location
- [ ] Specific pain point (from quiz data or public signals)
- [ ] A concrete number or finding specific to them
- [ ] Their name (not "Practice Owner")
