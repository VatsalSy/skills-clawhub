# Obsidian Daily Note

## Configuration

Set these to match your vault:

- **Base path**: path to your `DAILY` folder inside the vault
- **Sync**: adjust if using OneDrive / iCloud / Obsidian Sync

## File Naming

```
YYYY-MM-DD_short-summary.md
```

Examples:

- `2026-02-18_fix-env-gsudo-chrome.md`
- `2026-02-19_maibotalks-app-submit.md`

The title should briefly summarize the day's main activities.

## Template

```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD (Day) — Daily Note

## Completed Today

### [Category]
- **Task** → Result
  - Details

## Tomorrow's Actions

- [ ] Action 1
- [ ] Action 2
```

Category emoji prefixes: 🔧 Dev, 📱 Mobile, 🚀 Deploy, 🔗 Integration, 📝 Docs, 💡 Ideas, 📋 Planning

## Encoding

**CRITICAL on Windows**: Never use `Set-Content`. Always use:

```powershell
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $content, [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)
```

## Workflow

1. Collect today's activities from session context
2. Group by category
3. Generate filename with descriptive title
4. Write using UTF-8 encoding
5. Include tomorrow's action items from pending tasks

## Vault Structure (PARA)

- `00.DAILY/` — daily notes
- `01.PROJECT/` — project dashboards and kanban
- `02.AREA/` — ongoing areas of interest
- `03.RESOURCES/` — reference material
- `04.ARCHIVE/` — archived notes

Project docs live in `PROJECT_ROOT/docs/` with A/D/I/T prefixes (Analysis / Design / Implementation / Test).
