# DEPRECATED — Remove This Skill

This legacy listing was an early failed addition and is no longer maintained.

Reason: initial publication suffered from API/registry lag during rollout.

Please uninstall/remove this skill and use:

- `detect-file-type-local`

This placeholder exists only to mark deprecation and direct users to the replacement.
