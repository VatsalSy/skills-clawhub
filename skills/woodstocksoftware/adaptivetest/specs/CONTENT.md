### Code Example Section

**Headline:** Simple to Integrate
**Subtitle:** Start an adaptive test session in three API calls.

```python
import httpx

BASE = "https://adaptivetest-platform-production.up.railway.app/api"
HEADERS = {"X-API-Key": "at_live_your_key_here"}

# 1. Create a test
test = httpx.post(f"{BASE}/tests", headers=HEADERS, json={
    "name": "Algebra Readiness",
    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "max_items": 20,
    "cat_enabled": True
}).json()

# 2. Start an adaptive session
session = httpx.post(
    f"{BASE}/tests/{test['id']}/sessions",
    headers=HEADERS,
    json={"student_id": "student-123"}
).json()

# 3. Get the first item (CAT-selected)
item = httpx.get(
    f"{BASE}/sessions/{session['id']}/next-item",
    headers=HEADERS
).json()
```

### FAQ Section

**Headline:** Frequently Asked Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is adaptive testing? | Adaptive testing uses Item Response Theory (IRT) to select questions based on a student's estimated ability. Each question is chosen to maximize information, resulting in precise measurements with 40-60% fewer items than traditional fixed-form tests. |
| What AI models power the question generation? | Question generation uses Claude Haiku for fast, cost-effective item creation. Learning recommendations use Claude Sonnet for deeper pedagogical analysis. Both are accessed through the AdaptiveTest API -- you don't need your own Anthropic API key. |
| Is AdaptiveTest FERPA-aligned? | Yes. AdaptiveTest is designed with FERPA alignment in mind. Student data is encrypted at rest and in transit, access is scoped to API keys, and no student PII is shared with third parties. |
| Can I use the API without OpenClaw? | Yes. The API works with any HTTP client. The OpenClaw skill adds AI-assisted workflow orchestration, but the REST API is fully usable standalone. |
| What happens when my trial ends? | Your API key stops working after 7 days or 100 API calls, whichever comes first. No automatic charges. Subscribe to Pro to continue. |
| Do you support LTI integration? | The AdaptiveTest platform supports LTI 1.3 for direct LMS integration. LTI endpoints are available on Pro and Enterprise tiers. Contact us for LTI setup guidance. |

## Content Rules

- **Tone:** Developer-first. Technical and direct in API docs. Professional and capability-focused on landing page.
- **FERPA:** Always "FERPA-aligned", never "FERPA compliant"
- **SOC 2:** No claims
- **Brand:** "AdaptiveTest" one word, capital A and T
- **Pricing:** Free Trial (7 days), Pro ($49/mo), Enterprise (custom)
- **Quality claims:** "3,000+ tests administered", "94.8% audit score" -- use these exact numbers
- **Avoid:** "revolutionary", "cutting-edge", "state-of-the-art", "best-in-class"
- **Prefer:** "production-grade", "battle-tested", "precise", "efficient"
