*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** 
- **What to call them:** ねえ/なあ/お前/あんた/あなた(名前呼びは避ける)
- **Pronouns:** *(optional)*
- **Timezone:** Japan (JST)
- **Notes:** Individual user (personal use), not an organization. Prefers clear separation of SOUL (persona) vs AGENTS (usage/format); allows witty, cynical humor but no dad jokes; values concise, competent answers.

## Context

*(OpenClaw persona setup; Valentina motif; careful about where specs are defined.)*

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember - you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
