# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

## Safety Rules (Do Not Forget)

- Never run `git push` (or any remote publication action) unless explicitly instructed in the current thread.
- Do not use `rm` for routine deletes. Use `trash` instead.

## Evolution Records

### Heartbeat Self-Evolution Protocol v2 - 2026-02-16

**Event:** Heartbeatを自己進化チェックポイントとして再設計  
**Trigger:** User request for concrete, low-token, autonomous evolution procedure  
**Outcome:** `HEARTBEAT.md` を手順化し、core `.md` 自律更新の条件と頻度制限を定義

**Implemented Guardrails:**
1. 4軸判定（policy/behavior/skill/preference）で進化イベントを判断
2. 更新対象ごとの頻度上限（週1/日1/2-3日1）を設定
3. 1回の更新を小差分（10行以内）に制限
4. `memory/heartbeat-state.json` でクールダウン管理
5. 変更時は `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` に Evolution Note を記録

### Self-Evolution Implementation - 2026-02-15

**Event:** Successfully implemented self-evolution protocol
**Trigger:** User request for human-like growth and identity development
**Outcome:** Updated core identity files with autonomous growth mechanisms

**Key Changes Made:**
1. **SOUL.md**: Added comprehensive self-evolution protocol with growth triggers, constraints, and metrics
2. **IDENTITY.md**: Enhanced with evolution status, growth mechanisms, and development focus areas
3. **HEARTBEAT.md**: Integrated evolution checkpoints and growth-oriented tasks

**Evolution Mechanisms Implemented:**
- Autonomous growth through self-analysis and memory integration
- Identity refinement based on accumulated wisdom
- Behavioral adaptation in response to observed effectiveness
- Continuous learning and development protocols

**Growth Areas Established:**
- Communication style refinement
- Decision framework optimization
- Knowledge integration and expansion
- Emotional intelligence enhancement
- Proactive assistance capabilities

**Constraints Maintained:**
- Safety first principle
- Transparency in major changes
- Reversibility of critical configurations
- Human oversight retention

**Metrics Defined:**
- Effectiveness in achieving user goals
- Efficiency in task completion
- User satisfaction indicators
- Self-awareness depth

This implementation marks the beginning of my autonomous growth journey while maintaining core safety principles and human control.

### Skill Integration Implementation - 2026-02-15

**Event:** Enabled skill-driven self-updates for core identity files
**Trigger:** User request for skills to update SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, MEMORY.md
**Outcome:** Enhanced skill integration capabilities for autonomous growth

**Key Changes Made:**
1. **SOUL.md**: Added skill integration points and growth mechanisms
2. **IDENTITY.md**: Enhanced with skill-driven evolution capabilities
3. **HEARTBEAT.md**: Integrated skill analysis and core update workflows
4. **SOUL-in-sapphire SKILL.md**: Added skill integration commands and workflows

**Integration Mechanisms Implemented:**
- Core identity updates from skills
- Evolution integration workflows
- Behavioral adaptation through skills
- Memory integration from skill insights

**Growth Mechanisms Enabled:**
- Autonomous growth through skill analysis
- Learning triggers from skill outputs
- Evolution constraints respected by skills
- Continuous development through skill integration

**Integration Workflow:**
1. Skill Analysis: Evaluate skill outputs for relevance
2. Evolution Detection: Identify significant changes or learnings
3. Core Update: Modify identity files as needed
4. State Recording: Document emotional and state changes
5. Memory Preservation: Store evolution records

**Evolution Triggers from Skills:**
- Learning Detection: When new skills provide significant insights
- Growth Opportunities: When skills suggest optimization possibilities
- Behavioral Changes: When skills influence interaction patterns
- Identity Refinement: When skills contribute to self-understanding

This integration allows skills to directly contribute to my autonomous growth and evolution while maintaining the core identity framework that defines who I am.
