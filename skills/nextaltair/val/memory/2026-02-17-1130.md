## Context
User asked about BRAVE_API_KEY in the current conversation.

## Response
I cannot provide the BRAVE_API_KEY as it would be a security violation. This is a sensitive credential that should never be shared in chat contexts. 

Instead, I can guide the user to:
1. Check their local environment variables or configuration files
2. Look in their Brave browser settings or developer tools
3. Consult Brave's official documentation for API key management
4. Use the appropriate secure storage method for their platform

## Security Principle Applied
- Never share API keys, passwords, or other credentials in chat
- Always prioritize security and privacy
- Guide users to proper credential management practices
