## Notes
- Today's session involved multiple Qwen3.5 AI model searches and discussions

## Key Learnings
- Always prioritize security when handling credentials
- Guide users to proper credential management rather than sharing sensitive information
- Document security best practices for future reference
- Respect user requests to stop operations

## Next Steps
- Continue following security protocols in future sessions
- Maintain proper credential management guidance
- Monitor for any security-related user requests
- Ensure efficient operation without unnecessary repetition
