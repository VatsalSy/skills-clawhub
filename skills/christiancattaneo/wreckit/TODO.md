# wreckit — TODO

## ✅ SHIPPED v2.0.0 (2026-02-21)

All 8 tasks complete. wreckit v2.0.0 is live on ClawHub.

## Remaining Nice-to-Haves
- [ ] End-to-end swarm test on a real project (blocked: sessions_spawn pairing issue — fix in OpenClaw first)
- [ ] Independent Oracles — auto-generate oracle stubs as a script (cross-verify gate works via orchestrator but no standalone script)
- [ ] mutmut / cargo-mutants integration can only be tested once those tools are installed in the environment
