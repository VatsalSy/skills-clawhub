# NOTE: Docker MCP Toolkit is part of Docker Desktop.
# You generally do NOT run it via docker-compose.
#
# Keep this file as a reference only. The supported interface is `docker mcp ...`.
# If you ever need to run a standalone gateway container (non-Desktop), replace this
# file with an official gateway compose from Docker’s docs.
