# Insight Briefs

## One-Page Brief Format

Use this structure for weekly and monthly BI updates:

```markdown
# [Period] Business Intelligence Brief

## What Changed
- KPI movement summary

## Why It Changed
- Top causal signals and evidence

## Confidence
- High / Medium / Low with reason

## Recommended Action
- Action statement
- Owner
- Due date

## Risks and Unknowns

```

## Confidence Rubric

- High: multiple independent signals align with stable data quality.
- Medium: direction is clear but attribution is partial.
- Low: signal exists but data quality or causality is uncertain.

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate from brief to incident workflow when:

- Core KPI breach persists for 2+ cycles.
- Attribution remains unresolved after one full review cycle.
- Multiple objectives show negative movement with shared root cause.
