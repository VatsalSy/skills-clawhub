# Decision Cadence

## Cadence Framework

Set explicit rituals so BI drives execution, not just reporting.

## Daily

- Monitor leading indicators and threshold breaches.
- Assign same-day owner for severe deviations.
- Log unresolved anomalies for weekly review.

## Weekly

- Review metric tree by objective.
- Validate if interventions moved leading indicators.
- Publish one-page insight brief with owned actions.

## Monthly

- Audit KPI contracts and formula versions.
- Retire low-value metrics that no longer influence decisions.
- Rebalance dashboard real estate to active priorities.

## Quarterly

- Reconfirm strategic objectives and driver hierarchy.
- Re-map KPI portfolio to updated business goals.
- Reassign owners where execution accountability is unclear.

## Escalation Levels

| Level | Trigger | Response Window | Owner |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| L1 | Single KPI warning | 24h | KPI owner |
| L2 | Multi-KPI trend break | 72h | Function lead |
| L3 | Objective-level miss risk | 7d | Executive owner |
