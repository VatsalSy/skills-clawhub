# Shanghai Tech Neighborhoods (2026)

Shanghai tech activity is distributed, not single-center.
Choose location by office cluster and transport reliability.

| Zone | Typical profile | Good for | Cost level | Commute pattern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Zhangjiang (Pudong) | Large R&D parks, biotech, deep tech | Lab/engineering roles | Mid | Best if living on same metro corridors |
| West Bund / Xuhui tech belt | AI, software, startup offices | Product and design teams | Mid to high | Strong inner-city links |
| Hongqiao business area | Regional HQs, travel-heavy teams | Cross-city frequent travelers | Mid to high | Great rail/airport access |
| Wujiaochang-Yangpu pockets | University-adjacent innovation | Early-stage teams, talent pipelines | Mid | Can require transfers for other hubs |

## Selection rules that matter

- Optimize for first-hour commute reliability, not map distance.
- Prefer one-transfer metro routes when possible.
- Check coworking and backup workspaces near home.
- Test return trip times after 8pm, not only morning rush.

## Tech area checklist

- [ ] Confirm office shuttle availability (if offered).
- [ ] Verify cafe/work-friendly options within 10-15 minutes walk.
- [ ] Check weekend neighborhood livability, not only workday convenience.
- [ ] Validate mobile signal and building internet options.

## 2026 note

Company office policies and hybrid schedules continue to shift.
Reconfirm required in-office days before locking long leases.
