# Shanghai Climate and Weather Planning (2026)

Shanghai has four clear seasons, high humidity, and a long warm period.
Plan wardrobe and housing utilities around humidity swings.

## Seasonal overview

| Season | Typical temp range | Practical feel |
|---|---|---|
| Spring (Mar-May) | 10-24 C | Mild but variable, rain spells |
| Summer (Jun-Sep) | 26-35 C+ | Hot, humid, occasional heat waves |
| Autumn (Oct-Nov) | 14-26 C | Most comfortable period |
| Winter (Dec-Feb) | 1-11 C | Damp cold, indoor chill in older homes |

## Rain and typhoon window

| Pattern | Usually when | What to prepare |
|---|---|---|
| Plum rain season | Late spring to early summer | Quick-dry shoes, dehumidifier |
| Short intense storms | Summer | Backup commute plan |
| Typhoon impacts | Jul-Oct (variable) | Charge devices, monitor alerts |

## Monthly planning cheatsheet

| Month group | Main concern | Daily tip |
|---|---|---|
| Mar-Apr | Temperature swings | Layering works best |
| May-Jun | Humidity jump | Ventilate and control mold |
| Jul-Aug | Heat stress | Avoid midday outdoor exertion |
| Sep-Oct | Weather improvement | Best months for outdoor travel |
| Nov-Dec | Drying and cooling | Add light outerwear |
| Jan-Feb | Damp cold indoors | Portable heating and warm bedding |

## Home and clothing setup

1. Prioritize AC units with strong dehumidify mode.
2. Buy a dehumidifier if apartment ventilation is weak.
3. Keep summer and winter bedding; one set is rarely enough.
4. Carry compact rain gear from spring through autumn.
5. Use breathable fabrics for most of the year.

## Air quality note

AQI can fluctuate with weather and regional conditions.
Check same-day AQI before long outdoor workouts.
