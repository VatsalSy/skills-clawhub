# Shanghai Visitor Tips (2026)

This checklist focuses on friction points that affect real travel days.
Keep plans flexible and verify details in live apps.

## Before you fly

| Task | Why it matters | Practical target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visa/transit policy check | Entry rules can change | Re-check 2-3 weeks before departure |
| Phone setup | Many services are app-first | Install map, translation, ride-hailing, payment apps |
| Card + cash backup | Not every vendor behaves the same | Carry at least two payment methods |
| Travel insurance | Medical/admin support | Confirm coverage for outpatient and evacuation |

## After landing

- Use official taxi queues or app-based rides from marked pickup points.
- Buy or activate mobile data immediately for translation and navigation.
- Save hotel, key landmarks, and airport names in Chinese characters.
- Keep passport accessible for hotel check-in and some ticket checks.

## Daily city movement

- Metro is usually fastest for predictable travel.
- Taxis and ride-hailing are useful in rain or late evenings.
- Add 20-30 minutes buffer in peak commuting hours.
- Wear comfortable shoes; many areas are best explored on foot.

## Food and etiquette quick list

- [ ] Peak dining is crowded; reserve popular spots.
- [ ] Carry tissues and hand sanitizer for smaller eateries.
- [ ] Ask about allergens clearly; menu translation can be imperfect.
- [ ] Keep voice levels moderate in quiet venues.

## Weather and health

- Summers are hot and humid; hydrate and schedule indoor breaks.
- In cooler months, layered clothing works better than heavy single layers.
- Air quality can vary; sensitive travelers may want a mask option.

## 2026 planning note

Policies, app features, and payment acceptance evolve quickly.
Use official transport, venue, and government channels for final confirmation.
