# Shanghai Visitor Lodging Guide (2026)

Pick your stay by daily movement, not just room price.
A cheaper hotel can cost more in commute time.

| Area | Best for | Typical price tier | Tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| People's Square / Nanjing Road | First-time visitors, quick access | Mid to high | Busy, tourist-heavy at night |
| Jing'an | Food, shopping, easy metro links | Mid to high | Premium pricing on weekends |
| Former French Concession | Walkable cafes, boutique feel | Mid to high | Older buildings, varied room sizes |
| Lujiazui (Pudong) | Business trips, skyline hotels | Mid to high | Less street life late night |
| Xuhui / West Bund edge | Art, quieter evenings | Mid | Longer ride to some headline sights |
| Near Hongqiao hub | Early trains/flights, expo travel | Mid | Far from Bund nightlife |

## Property type quick pick

- Full-service hotel: easiest for short trips, late arrivals, and concierge support.
- Serviced apartment: better for 5+ nights, laundry, and extra workspace.
- Boutique lane-house stay: strong character, but room layouts vary.

## 2026 planning note
