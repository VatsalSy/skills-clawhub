## Price Expectations (CNY per person)
- Casual international lunch: 70-150
- Mid-range dinner: 180-350
- Premium international dining: 400-900
- Top tasting menu: 900+

## Booking And Timing
- Reserve in advance for omakase, steak, and weekend brunch.
- Weekday lunch sets often give best value at upscale places.
- Sunday evening is usually easier for walk-ins than Friday night.

## Quality Filters
- Prefer places with consistent menu focus over oversized menus.
- Check how long the restaurant has operated, not only recent hype.
- In malls, choose brands with local repeat customers.
- For wine-heavy venues, confirm bottle markups before ordering.

## Practical Tips
- Allergy communication is easier at established international venues.
- Ask whether service charge applies; some hotel venues add it.
- Keep one backup in the same district to avoid long cross-city rides.
