# Moving to Shanghai: Resident Setup (2026)

Practical checklist for your first month in Shanghai.
Use this as a sequence, not a legal document.

## First 7 days

| Task | Why it matters | Typical timing |
|---|---|---|
| Secure temporary stay | Gives time to choose district calmly | Before arrival |
| Local SIM + data plan | Needed for banking, apps, ride-hailing | Day 1 |
| Police registration | Mandatory after moving address | Within 24 hours of move |
| Open local bank account | Salary, rent, and utility payments | Days 2-7 |
| Set up WeChat + Alipay | Core daily payment rails | Days 1-3 |

## First month priorities

1. Pick housing close to Metro Line 2/9/10/11 if commuting to central areas.
2. Review lease in Chinese and English before paying deposit.
3. Record apartment condition photos on move-in day.
4. Confirm internet speed in-unit, not only in lobby.
5. Keep digital copies of passport, visa, lease, and registration slip.

## Rental terms you will commonly see

| Item | Typical Shanghai range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Deposit | 1-2 months rent | 2 months is still common |
| Rent payment cycle | 1-3 months prepaid | Quarterly is frequent |
| Agency fee | 35%-100% of one month rent | Negotiable in slower market |
| Lease length | 12 months | Break clauses vary |

## Monthly admin basics

| Item | Typical cost (CNY) | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Home internet | 100-250 | Fiber plan, speed varies by building |
| Electricity + water + gas | 250-900 | AC use drives summer/winter peaks |
| Building management fee | Often included, sometimes extra | Confirm in contract |

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Paying large deposits before seeing landlord ID and property proof.
- Choosing a unit only by photos; check noise at night.
- Forgetting police registration after each address change.
- Assuming all compounds allow pets or short-term guests.
- Waiting too long to set up tax and payroll details with employer.

## Reality check for 2026

- Mobile payment is dominant, but carry a backup card and some cash.
- Good apartments move fast in Jingan, Xuhui, and central Huangpu.
- Rules can change by district; verify with local authorities or HR.
