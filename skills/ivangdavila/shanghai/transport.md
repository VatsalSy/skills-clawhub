## Payment and apps

1. Enable Shanghai transit QR in Alipay or WeChat.
2. Keep DiDi app in English mode and save home/work pins.
3. Use Amap or Baidu Maps for live transfer planning.
4. Keep one backup method if phone battery dies.

## Rush-hour realities

- Peak crowding is usually weekday 07:30-09:30 and 17:30-19:30.
- Rain can sharply increase DiDi wait times and pricing.
- Allow 10-20 extra minutes for transfers in large interchanges.

## Practical recommendation

If you live and work near Metro, monthly transport often stays moderate.
Car ownership is usually a lifestyle choice, not a necessity.
