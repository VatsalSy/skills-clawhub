| Attraction | Why go | Best time | Typical visit | Practical note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Bund | Iconic skyline walk and photos | Sunrise or after sunset | 1-2 hours | Night views are best; weekends are crowded |
| Yu Garden + Old City | Classic architecture, snacks, bazaars | Early morning weekdays | 2-3 hours | Some lanes are tourist-heavy; wander side streets |
| Shanghai Museum East or People's Square museums | Strong history and art collections | Mid-morning | 2-3 hours | Check reservation rules before arrival |
| Former French Concession streets | Cafe culture, leafy lanes, design shops | Late morning to sunset | 2-4 hours | Best explored on foot between metro stops |
| Jing'an Temple area | Historic-modern contrast | Evening | 1-2 hours | Combine with nearby malls and dining |
| Lujiazui viewpoints | Skyline from the financial district | Sunset to night | 2-3 hours | Timed-entry towers can sell out on holidays |
| West Bund / Xuhui riverside | Contemporary art + river walks | Afternoon | 2-4 hours | Good backup plan when central sites are packed |
| Zhujiajiao water town (day trip) | Canal town feel near city | Weekday morning | Half day | Start early to avoid tour bus peaks |
