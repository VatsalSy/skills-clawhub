# Shanghai Food Overview

## Snapshot
- Shanghai dining is broad: local Shanghainese, all major Chinese regional cuisines, and strong international options.
- Best balance of quality and convenience is in Xuhui, Jing'an, and Huangpu.
- Most places are busy at lunch (12:00-13:30) and dinner (18:00-20:00).
- Delivery is reliable citywide, but dine-in is still better for local specialties.

## Typical Budget (CNY per person)
- Street breakfast: 10-25
- Casual local meal: 35-90
- Mid-range sit-down: 120-280
- Upscale dining: 300-700
- Fine dining tasting menu: 800+

## What Shanghai Does Best
- Xiaolongbao, shengjianbao, hongshao pork, river crab dishes in season.
- Jiangnan-style cooking (mild sweetness, braised and steamed techniques).
- Seafood from nearby Zhejiang and Jiangsu supply chains.
- Late coffee and dessert culture in the Former French Concession.

## Best Times To Eat
- Breakfast: 07:00-09:30 for fresh buns and soy milk.
- Lunch: 11:30-13:00 to avoid long queues.
- Dinner: arrive before 18:00 at popular places.
- Weekend brunch: book ahead in Xuhui and Jing'an.

## Reservation And Queue Reality
- Popular restaurants fill quickly on Friday and Saturday nights.
- Mall restaurants are easier for walk-ins than stand-alone hotspots.
- Ask your hotel or local colleague to help with Chinese-only booking pages.

## Payment And Service Basics

- Keep some cash only for small, older shops.
- Tipping is not expected in most restaurants.
- Water and tea service policies vary; ask before ordering bottles.
