## One day: city highlights

| Time | Plan | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Two days: balanced first visit

- Evening: Huangpu river cruise or rooftop bar.

Day 2

## Three days: deeper pace

Day 1: Core skyline and historic center.
Day 2: Concession neighborhoods plus modern art.
Day 3: Half-day trip to Zhujiajiao, then relaxed city dinner.

## Practical pacing checklist

- [ ] Limit to 2 major zones per day; crossing the river repeatedly costs time.
- [ ] Keep 60-90 minutes buffer for transit and queues.
- [ ] Reserve one low-effort evening after heavy walking days.
- [ ] Swap outdoor blocks for malls or museums during storms.
- [ ] Confirm last metro times if staying out late.

## 2026 planning note

Holiday traffic, weather alerts, and reservation windows shift year to year.
Use real-time transport and ticket apps for final same-day decisions.
