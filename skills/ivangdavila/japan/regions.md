# Regions Overview — Japan

## Main Travel Regions

| Region | Trip Identity |
|--------|---------------|
| Tokyo and Kanto | Urban density, museums, food variety, strongest transit network |
| Kyoto-Nara corridor | Heritage sites, temples, seasonal foliage demand |
| Osaka and Kansai | Food-first city pace and practical day-trip access |
| Hiroshima and western routes | History, island access, calmer urban rhythm |
| Hokkaido | Nature, seafood, winter routes, wider distances |
| Okinawa | Beaches, subtropical climate, distinct regional culture |
| Central Alps | Mountain towns and activity-first logistics |

## Route Planning Rule

Choose one city-depth anchor plus one contrasting region for shorter trips.
For longer trips, use 2-3 bases max to avoid transfer-heavy fatigue.
