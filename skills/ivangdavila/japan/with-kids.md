# Japan with Kids

## Good Family Bases

| Base | Why it works |
|------|--------------|
| Tokyo | Wide mix of parks, museums, and flexible transport |
| Kyoto | Heritage and culture with compact planning blocks |
| Osaka | Food, attractions, and manageable city movement |
| Hiroshima | Slower pace and strong short-route options |

## Family Planning Rules

- Keep transfer legs shorter than map intuition suggests.
- Plan one anchor activity per day plus downtime.
- Build weather and heat backups into daily plans.

## Age-Based Tips

### Younger kids
- Short activity blocks, predictable meals, and park breaks

### Older kids
- Mix culture stops, food routes, and one active element daily

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overbooking transfer-heavy schedules.
2. Ignoring heat and hydration planning in summer.
3. Choosing accommodation far from core daily routes.
