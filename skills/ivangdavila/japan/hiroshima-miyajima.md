# Hiroshima and Miyajima Complete Guide

## Core Reality

This area works best with intentional pacing: one day for Hiroshima city history and food, one day for Miyajima timing and ferry logistics.

## Base Strategy

### Hiroshima city
- Best for Peace Memorial area, museums, and evening okonomiyaki routes.
- Walkable central zones support a low-stress short stay.

### Miyajima day route
- Better with early or late timing to reduce peak crowd windows.
- Ferry and ropeway timing should be checked before departure.

## Route Rules

- Keep at least one overnight if combining city and island.
- Avoid stacking long transfer day plus major museum circuit.
- Build weather backup for island viewpoints.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Treating Miyajima as a rushed 2-hour stop.
2. Missing final ferry planning and return buffer.
3. Overloading emotional-heavy history visits with no rest time.
