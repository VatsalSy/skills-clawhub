- Neighborhood clustering beats zig-zag planning across the city.
- Reserve flagship dinners early and keep backup casual options.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Packing too many distant neighborhoods into one day.
2. Only eating in station-adjacent chain zones.
3. Ignoring last-train timing after nightlife.
4. Assuming every famous spot is best at peak hours.
