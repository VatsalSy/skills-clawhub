# Accommodation Guide — Japan

## Booking Strategy

1. Use fewer bases and stay 2+ nights where possible.
2. Prioritize station access and neighborhood fit over pure price.
3. Book high-demand seasonal windows early.

## Tokyo

- **Best convenience:** Shinjuku, Tokyo Station, and major transit-connected zones
- **Best value compromise:** Ueno, Asakusa, and selected east-side areas
- **Watch:** Tiny-room tradeoffs in ultra-central budget listings

## Kyoto

- **Best convenience:** Central and station-adjacent zones
- **Best atmosphere:** Gion/Higashiyama edge with early-booking discipline

## Osaka

- **Best convenience:** Umeda and Namba-access corridors
- **Better nightlife value:** Tenma and nearby local neighborhoods

## Hiroshima and West Add-ons

- **Hiroshima city:** strong base for museum plus island split
- **Miyajima overnight:** good only when route pacing supports it
