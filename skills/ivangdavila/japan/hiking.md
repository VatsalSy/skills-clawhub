# Hiking Guide — Japan

## Core Rule

Pick hikes by season, weather alerts, and realistic fitness, not only photos.

## Strong Areas

### Japanese Alps
- Major mountain routes with strong views and fast weather shifts.

### Kumano Kodo and pilgrimage routes
- Cultural-hiking blend with logistics that need advance planning.

### Hokkaido and northern trails
- Nature-heavy routes with seasonal access differences.

## Safety Basics

- Start earlier in mountain and heat-prone routes.
- Carry water, layers, and offline maps.
- Respect closures, weather alerts, and wildlife guidelines.
- Turn back when conditions degrade.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Casual footwear on technical or wet terrain.
2. Ignoring weather shifts at higher elevation.
3. Starting too late for longer trail days.
4. Copying social content without current-condition checks.
