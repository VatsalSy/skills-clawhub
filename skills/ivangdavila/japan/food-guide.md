## Reliable Food Cities

### Tokyo
Best range and specialization density, but requires smarter reservation strategy.

### Osaka
Strongest casual food culture and late dining options.

### Kyoto
Best for traditional cuisine depth and seasonal dining.

## Practical Dining Rules

- Reserve high-demand dinners early, especially Fri-Sun.
- Lunch sets often deliver better value than dinner courses.
- Queue quality varies; popularity alone is not enough signal.
- Keep one backup option near each planned area.

## Food Traps to Avoid

1. Eating only in landmark-adjacent corridors.
2. Overcommitting to social-media queues.
3. Ignoring reservation windows for top counters.
4. Planning heavy tasting routes without pacing.
