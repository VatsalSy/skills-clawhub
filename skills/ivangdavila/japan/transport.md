# Transport Guide — Japan

## In Cities

- Tokyo and Osaka rail-plus-metro systems cover most visitor routes.
- Kyoto mixes rail, buses, and walking depending on zone.
- Neighborhood clustering reduces transfer fatigue and missed timings.

## Intercity

### Shinkansen and rail
- Best option for most major city-to-city routes.
- Seat reservations matter in peak seasonal windows.

### Domestic flights
- Useful for long jumps (for example Hokkaido or Okinawa links).
- Include airport transfer and baggage buffer in timing.

### Regional passes
- Can be high value only when route math supports them.
- Compare pass cost against planned point-to-point fares first.

## Practical Rules

- Avoid same-day long transfer plus heavy sightseeing stack.
- Keep backup routes for disruption days.
- Check first and last train windows for nightlife plans.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Buying a pass without comparing real route costs.
2. Booking tight station-to-tour transitions.
3. Underestimating transfer time inside large stations.
