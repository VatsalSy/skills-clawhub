# Beaches and Coastal Stops — Japan

## Southern and Island Options

- **Okinawa main island beaches:** strongest tropical beach identity in Japan
- **Ishigaki and Miyako routes:** clearer water with higher logistics overhead
- **Amami and smaller island options:** lower crowd pressure in selected windows

## Mainland Coastal Options

- **Kamakura and Shonan side:** easy from Tokyo with mixed beach-town vibe
- **Setouchi coastal stops:** best as part of culture-plus-island routing
- **Izu Peninsula areas:** practical coast add-on with onsen overlap

## Practical Notes

- Typhoon season and summer weather shifts require backup planning.
- Beach quality and swimming conditions vary strongly by region.
- Ferry and flight dependencies can reshape island schedules.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Planning beach-only days with no weather backup.
2. Ignoring transfer logistics to smaller islands.
3. Underestimating humidity and UV load in peak summer.
