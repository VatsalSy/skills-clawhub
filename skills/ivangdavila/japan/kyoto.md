## Kyoto Strategy

- Start temples early and shift to food or museum blocks at midday.
- Use buses selectively; walk-and-train combinations are often more predictable.
- Plan one lighter evening after heavy temple days.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Visiting top temples only at midday peak.
2. Overstacking distant temple zones in one day.
3. Assuming every tea-house area is open late.
