# Milan Visitor Tips

## First 24 Hours Checklist

1. Buy or activate public transport ticket correctly.
2. Confirm major reservations (Last Supper, Duomo slot, top dinner).
3. Map neighborhood priorities to avoid unnecessary transit.
4. Set weather fallback plans for rain.

## Transit Tips

- Validate paper tickets immediately.
- Keep metro and tram ticket until journey ends.
- Use train stations early for day trips to avoid sold-out regional seats.

## Food and Timing Tips

- Many kitchens open later for dinner than in the US.
- Aperitivo is usually a pre-dinner social meal window.
- Avoid tourist-heavy menus around main squares unless reviews are strong.

## Money and Payments

- Cards are widely accepted, but keep small cash for backup.
- Dynamic currency conversion on card terminals is usually a bad deal.
- Watch for event-week surcharge pricing in central districts.

## Etiquette Basics

- Dress slightly smarter for upscale dining and theatre.
- Keep voice level moderate in residential late-night areas.
- Respect queue behavior in transport and services.

## Day Trips That Actually Work

| Destination | Typical Time | Why It Works |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Lake Como | 40-70 min by train | Scenic and easy logistics |
| Bergamo | 50-60 min by train | Historic upper city, low friction |
| Turin | 1h by high-speed rail | Museums, food, architecture |
| Bologna | About 1h by high-speed rail | Strong food and walkable center |

## Peak Event Survival

- Book accommodation and trains early.
- Expect longer waits for taxis and top restaurants.
- Shift museum visits to early slots.
