# Milan Climate and Season Planning

## Annual Pattern

Milan has four distinct seasons with hot summers, colder winters, and frequent shoulder-season rain.

## Seasonal Reality

| Season | Typical Conditions | Planning Notes |
|--------|--------------------|----------------|
| Winter (Dec-Feb) | About 0-10 deg C, fog episodes | Layering and indoor backup plans |
| Spring (Mar-May) | About 10-22 deg C, variable rain | Flexible clothing and shoes |
| Summer (Jun-Aug) | About 25-35 deg C, humidity spikes | Heat management and AC checks |
| Autumn (Sep-Nov) | About 10-24 deg C, rainy periods | Umbrella and transport buffer |

## Best Months by Goal

- Sightseeing comfort: April-May and September-October.
- Fashion and design events: spring and early autumn windows.
- Lower tourist pressure: late autumn and winter (except holidays).

## Weather Traps

- Underestimating humidity in summer.
- Planning full outdoor itineraries without rain fallback.
- Choosing housing without checking winter heating quality.

## Practical Packing Rules

1. Bring layers year-round.
2. Keep waterproof option in spring and autumn.
3. Include comfortable walking shoes for long urban routes.
