# Practical Food Rules for Milan

- Many kitchens close between lunch and dinner service.

## Dietary and Allergen Handling

| Need | Practical Approach |
|------|--------------------|
| Vegetarian | Increasing options in Isola, Porta Romana, Brera |
| Vegan | Verify menu depth, not only one token option |
| Gluten-free | Ask explicitly about contamination protocols |
| Halal | Search by district in advance |

## Service and Billing Basics

- Coperto and service items are normal in many venues.
- Ask for water preference (still vs sparkling).
- Request bill split policy before ordering in groups.

## Coffee Culture Shortcuts

- Bar counter coffee is faster and often cheaper.
