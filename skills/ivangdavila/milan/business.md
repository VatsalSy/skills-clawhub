# Business Setup in Milan

## Why Milan for Business

Milan is Italy's financial and commercial center, with strong access to legal services, investors, design networks, and international customers.

## Common Company Structures

| Structure | Typical Use | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| SRL | Most small and medium companies | Flexible and common choice |
| SRLS | Lean startup variant of SRL | Lower startup threshold |
| SPA | Larger companies | Higher governance complexity |
| Sole proprietorship | Freelancers and solo operators | Simpler but less separation |

## Setup Priorities

1. Select structure and governance model.
2. Finalize tax and accounting setup.
3. Open business banking and payment stack.
4. Register contracts and compliance basics.

## Operational Cost Drivers

- Payroll taxes and social contributions.
- Professional service costs (legal, accounting).
- Office or coworking cost by district.
- Event and travel spend for sales cycles.

## Practical Business Districts

- Porta Nuova and central business corridors for corporate proximity.
- CityLife for modern office infrastructure.
- Outer districts for lower operating cost if client-facing centrality is lower.
