# Comparison Checklist — Health Insurance

Run this checklist before final recommendation.

| Check | Pass/Fail | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Required providers are in-network |  |  |
| Required medications are covered on acceptable tiers |  |  |
| Premium and deductible fit budget limits |  |  |
| Out-of-pocket maximum is within risk tolerance |  |  |
| Referral and authorization friction is acceptable |  |  |
| Emergency and out-of-network behavior understood |  |  |
| Renewal and effective dates confirmed |  |  |
| Documents and evidence saved for appeals/billing |  |  |

## Final Recommendation Pattern

1. Identify the plan with best expected annual cost.
2. Compare downside risk under high-use scenario.
3. If tie, prefer lower administrative friction and better provider continuity.
4. Provide a one-line recommendation plus two quantified trade-offs.
