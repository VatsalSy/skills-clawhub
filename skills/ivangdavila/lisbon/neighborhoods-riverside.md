## River Access Notes

All these neighborhoods share Tagus River proximity. What that means:

**Swimming**: NOT at Lisbon's riverside. The Tagus is an estuary—currents, pollution concerns, no beaches. For swimming:
- Costa da Caparica (south, bus/ferry)
- Cascais beaches (west, train)
- Carcavelos (west, train)

**Riverfront activities**:
- Running/cycling along Belém-Docas strip
- Sunset watching from Docas or Cais do Sodré
- Ferry rides for views
- Water sports from Belém (kayak, paddle)

**Ferry connections from Cais do Sodré**:
- Cacilhas: 10 min, great views, riverside restaurants
- Trafaria: Access to Costa da Caparica
- Montijo: Longer trip, connects to Alentejo
