# Lisbon Food & Dining Overview

## The Portuguese Food Philosophy

Portuguese cuisine is the antithesis of flashy. It's peasant food elevated through quality ingredients and centuries of refinement. Don't expect molecular gastronomy—expect perfectly grilled fish, bread that matters, and portions that challenge.

### Core Principles
- **Simplicity**: Few ingredients, perfect execution
- **Seafood dominance**: Portugal has Europe's highest fish consumption
- **Bread culture**: Every meal starts with bread (couvert)
- **Wine integration**: Wine is food's companion, not an afterthought
- **Generous portions**: Portuguese hospitality means abundance

### Meal Structure

**Pequeno-almoço (Breakfast)** 7:00-10:00
Light by international standards:
- Galão (weak latte) or café (espresso)
- Pastel de nata or torrada (toast with butter)
- At most: ham/cheese toast (tosta mista)

**Almoço (Lunch)** 12:30-15:00
The main meal for many Portuguese:
- Full plate with protein, rice/potatoes, salad
- Prato do dia (dish of the day) at tascas
- Longer sit-down than Northern Europeans expect

**Jantar (Dinner)** 19:30-22:30
- Similar structure to lunch
- Starts late by tourist standards
- Many restaurants don't open until 19:00
- Peak seating: 20:30-21:00

**Lanche (Afternoon snack)** 16:00-18:00
- Coffee and pastry
- Light sandwiches
- Common tradition, especially with older generation

## The Couvert System

**What it is**: Bread, butter, olives, cheese, etc. brought to table automatically.

**Critical to know**:
- **It's NOT free** (usually €3-6 total)
- You can **send it back** if you don't want it
- Just say "não obrigado" when they bring it
- You're only charged for what you consume
- Higher-end restaurants: more elaborate, more expensive
- Never assume it's complimentary

**Tourist trap version**: Fancy cured meats, expensive cheese, charged €15. Always ask prices.

## How to Eat Like a Local

### Breakfast
Skip hotel breakfast occasionally. Go to:
- A local pastelaria (pastry shop)
- Stand at the counter
- Order "um café e um pastel de nata"
- Watch the morning rush

### Lunch
Find a tasca with "prato do dia":
- Usually €8-12
- Includes soup, main, sometimes drink
- Often better than fancier restaurants
- Ask what's today's dish: "Qual é o prato do dia?"

### Dinner
- Don't arrive before 19:30 (nothing will be ready)
- Expect larger portions than tapas cultures
- Sharing is normal—order a few dishes for table
- Finish with coffee (never cappuccino after a meal)

### Tipping
- Not expected like US
- Round up or 5-10% for good service
- Don't feel obligated
- Card tips less common (leave cash if tipping)

## Dietary Considerations

### Vegetarian

- Always ask: "Tem pratos vegetarianos?"

### Vegan
- Growing scene but still limited
- Dedicated vegan restaurants exist
- Traditional Portuguese: very difficult
- Apps: Happy Cow for finding spots

### Gluten-Free
- More awareness now
- Traditional bread culture makes it tricky
- Fine dining accommodates well
- Celiac: communicate clearly ("sou celíaco/a")

### Halal
- Muslim community means some options
- Mouraria has halal butchers
- Not widely labeled in mainstream restaurants

### Kosher
- Limited options
- Jewish community in Lisbon small
- Contact synagogue for recommendations
