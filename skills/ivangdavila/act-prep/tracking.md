# Progress Tracking System

## What to Track

### Per Practice Test
```
~/act/practice/YYYY-MM-DD.md

Date: 2024-01-15
Type: Full practice / Section drill
Conditions: Timed / Untimed

Scores:
- English: 28
- Math: 31
- Reading: 26
- Science: 29
- Composite: 29

Time Analysis:
- English: Finished with 3min left
- Math: Ran out of time (skipped 4)
- Reading: Finished exactly
- Science: 1min left

Error Log:
- E#23: Comma splice — didn't see independent clauses
- M#45: Forgot 30-60-90 triangle ratios
- R#12: Inference too far — answer was literal in text
```

### Per Section Progress
```
~/act/sections/math.md

Current score: 31
Target score: 34
Gap: 3 points

Strong areas:
- Basic algebra (98% accuracy)
- Coordinate geometry (92% accuracy)

Weak areas (high-ROI):
- Word problem setup (74% accuracy) → +2 points potential
- Trig identities (68% accuracy) → +1 point potential
- Matrices (60% accuracy) → rare on test, skip

Action items:
1. Drill word problems daily (20 min)
2. Review trig on weekend
```

## Score Trend Analysis

Track over time:
- Best composite ever (for superscore planning)
- Best per-section ever
- Average of last 3 tests (current level)
- Improvement rate (points/month)

## Red Flags to Surface

- Section stuck for 3+ practice tests → strategy problem, not knowledge
- Time issues not improving → pacing drills needed
- Same error types repeating → concept gap, needs targeted study
- Score dropping → burnout risk, reduce volume
