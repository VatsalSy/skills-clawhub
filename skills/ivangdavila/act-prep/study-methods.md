# Study Methods and Pacing

## Study Timeline

| Weeks Out | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| 12+ | Diagnostic → identify weak sections → learn content |
| 8-12 | Section drills → timed practice → strategy refinement |
| 4-8 | Full practice tests weekly → error analysis → targeted review |
| 1-4 | Maintain timing → review weak topics → reduce volume |
| Last week | Light review only → rest → logistics prep |

## Session Types

### Content Learning (early phase)
- Focus on ONE topic (e.g., comma rules, trig ratios)
- Learn the concept, then drill 10-20 questions
- Untimed initially, add time pressure gradually
- Duration: 30-45 min

### Section Drill (mid phase)
- Full section under real time conditions
- Immediate error review
- Log error types in tracking
- Duration: 45-75 min depending on section

### Full Practice Test (late phase)
- Simulate real test day
- All sections in order with breaks
- Score and review same day if possible
- Duration: 3-4 hours

### Error Review (after every practice)
- For EACH wrong answer:
  - Why was my answer wrong?
  - Why is the correct answer right?
  - What should I recognize next time?
- Log patterns in section tracking files

## Pacing Drills

**English pacing:** Practice finishing passages in 8 min (not 9)

**Math pacing:** Set checkpoint — 30 questions done at 30 min mark

**Reading pacing:** 8 min per passage MAX, move on even if questions remain

**Science pacing:** 5 min per passage, skip to easier passage if stuck

## Common Mistakes

- Studying weak section too much → neglecting stronger sections that could go higher
- Doing untimed practice too long → timing is half the battle
- Not reviewing errors → repeating same mistakes
- Cramming before test → fatigue hurts more than last-minute learning helps
