## Superscore Strategy

Many colleges take your highest section scores across multiple tests.

**When to retake:**
- One section significantly lower than others
- Confident that section can improve
- Time and budget allow

**Planning retakes:**
- Focus prep on lowest section only
- No need to maintain all sections at peak
- Check if target colleges superscore (most do)

## Scholarship Thresholds

Many state schools have automatic scholarships at score cutoffs:
- 30+ often triggers merit aid
- 33+ at many schools = full tuition
- Check specific school policies

## Score Submission Strategy

**Score Choice:** ACT lets you choose which test dates to send

**Planning:**
- Take first test early (spring of junior year)
- Retake fall of senior year if needed
- Superscore from multiple sittings

## Writing Score Requirements

Check each college:
- Required: Must submit Writing score
- Recommended: Submit if decent (8+)
- Not considered: Skip Writing to save energy

Most competitive colleges no longer require Writing (trend since 2020).
