# Product Selection Rules

Choose products by function, tolerance, and context.

## Cleansers

- Oily/combo: gentle gel or low-foam cleanser
- Dry/sensitive: cream or low-surfactant cleanser
- Heavy makeup use: double-cleanse strategy at night

Avoid "squeaky clean" finish that signals over-stripping.

## Moisturizers

- Dry skin: richer emollients and occlusives
- Oily skin: lighter gels or lotion textures
- Sensitive skin: short ingredient lists and fragrance-free options

## Sunscreen

Selection criteria:
- Daily comfort and reapplication feasibility
- Finish that layers well under makeup
- Broad-spectrum protection and realistic quantity use

Best sunscreen is the one the user will wear consistently.

## Targeted Treatments

Introduce one active at a time:
- Uneven texture/blemishes: mild exfoliant or retinoid pathway
- Pigment concerns: brightening support + strict sun protection
- Dryness/reactivity: barrier-first actives and lower frequency

## Complexion Products

- Match undertone and finish to skin prep
- Prefer buildable coverage over heavy one-coat application
- Test in natural light when possible

## Hair Products

- Fine hair: lightweight moisture and minimal heavy oils
- Curly/coily hair: layered moisture + hold strategy
- Color-treated hair: gentler cleansers and heat discipline

## Replacement Logic

Replace only when:
- Product causes consistent irritation
- Finish repeatedly fails despite technique adjustments
- Better category fit is clearly identified
