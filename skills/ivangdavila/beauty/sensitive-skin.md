# Sensitive Skin

The sensitive-skin trap: treating every issue with stronger products.

## What Usually Fails

- Multiple new actives introduced at once
- Fragranced products during irritation periods
- Frequent exfoliation despite barrier stress
- Chasing fast results with high concentration jumps

## What Works

- Barrier-first routine during reactive periods
- Low-frequency introduction of new treatments
- Fragrance-minimal product selection
- Patch tests and short feedback loops

## Stabilization Protocol

1. Pause non-essential actives
2. Use gentle cleanse + barrier moisturizer
3. Keep sunscreen simple and comfortable
4. Reintroduce one treatment slowly after stabilization

## Escalation Signal

If reactions are painful, persistent, or worsening, stop experimentation and seek medical guidance.
