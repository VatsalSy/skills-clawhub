# Budget Beauty

The budget trap: chasing viral products instead of reliable basics.

## What Usually Fails

- Spending heavily on one hero product while basics are weak
- Buying duplicates in the same category
- Ignoring cost-per-use and replacement frequency
- Keeping products that do not perform

## What Works

- Build a core kit before niche categories
- Use multi-use products when possible
- Replace weak performers quickly instead of collecting backups
- Set monthly spend caps by category

## Priority Order

1. Cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen
2. One complexion product that matches well
3. One treatment aligned to primary concern
4. Optional color and finish extras

## Savings Heuristics

- Trial sizes first for uncertain categories
- Keep a "repurchase only" list
- Pause purchases when routine is stable and working
