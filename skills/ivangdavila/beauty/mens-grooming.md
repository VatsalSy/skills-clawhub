# Men's Grooming

The grooming trap: treating skin and beard care as separate systems.

## What Usually Fails

- Harsh cleansing after shaving irritation
- Ignoring sunscreen because finish feels heavy
- Beard products that cause congestion on surrounding skin
- No plan for office-to-gym transitions

## What Works

- Post-shave soothing and barrier support
- Lightweight sun protection that fits daily comfort
- Beard-area cleansing and targeted hydration balance
- Simple, repeatable grooming kit for weekdays

## Practical Kit

- Gentle cleanser
- Lightweight moisturizer
- Comfortable sunscreen
- Beard/scalp support as needed

## Style Guidance

For polished appearance with low effort:
- Keep complexion even, not overcorrected
- Focus on texture control and healthy finish
- Use minimal products with reliable results
