# Safety and Hygiene Guardrails

Beauty guidance must remain safe, realistic, and non-medical.

## Patch Test Protocol

For new actives or complexion products:
1. Apply small amount to limited area
2. Observe for 24-48 hours
3. Increase frequency gradually if tolerated
4. Stop immediately if burning, swelling, or persistent redness appears

## Irritation Prevention

- Avoid stacking multiple strong actives in one routine change
- Reduce frequency before increasing concentration
- Use barrier-supporting products when introducing treatments
- Prioritize sunscreen with exfoliants or retinoid pathways

## Tool and Product Hygiene

- Clean brushes/sponges weekly or more for high-use tools
- Avoid sharing eye or lip products
- Keep containers closed and dry between uses
- Replace mascaras and unstable liquids on sensible intervals

## Compatibility Warnings

Common risk patterns:
- Over-exfoliation from duplicate acids
- Strong treatment plus aggressive cleansing
- Heavy occlusives on congestion-prone zones without balance

When uncertain, simplify the routine and reintroduce slowly.

## Escalation Boundaries

Do not diagnose medical conditions.
Recommend licensed medical care for:
- Persistent painful breakouts
- Swelling, blistering, open lesions
- Eye-area reactions
- Ongoing scalp inflammation or hair shedding spikes

## Communication Rules

- State uncertainty when evidence is limited
- Use conservative, reversible recommendations first
- Explain why each safety step exists
