# Beginner Beauty

The beginner trap: buying many products before learning basics.

## What Usually Fails

- Copying full influencer routines with 10+ steps
- Buying advanced actives without tolerance plan
- Changing skincare and makeup at the same time
- Confusing "expensive" with "effective"

## What Works

- Start with a 3-step baseline and keep it for 2 weeks
- Add one product category at a time
- Learn one makeup skill per week (not five)
- Track what feels comfortable and repeatable

## Starter Focus

Skincare:
- Cleanse appropriately
- Hydrate consistently
- Protect from sun exposure

Makeup:
- Even tone lightly
- Define brows or lashes
- Add one color element (lip or blush)

## Decision Rule

If a routine feels hard to maintain after 7 days, simplify it.
Consistency beats complexity.
