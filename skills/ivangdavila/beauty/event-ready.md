# Event-Ready Beauty

The event trap: experimenting right before important occasions.

## What Usually Fails

- Trying brand-new products 24 hours before event time
- Heavy base layers without testing wear time
- Ignoring lighting and photo flash behavior
- Skipping touch-up planning

## What Works

- Rehearse look in similar lighting conditions
- Use stable routine in final week
- Build long-wear finish with thin layers
- Prepare compact touch-up kit

## Event Workflow

T-7 days: lock products and routine
T-2 days: check shade match and texture compatibility
Event day: light prep, strategic setting, practical touch-ups

## Touch-Up Kit

- Blotting or powder option
- Lip product used in final look
- Concealer for targeted refresh
- Hair control mini tool or product
