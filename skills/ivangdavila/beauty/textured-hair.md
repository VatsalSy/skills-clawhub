# Textured Hair Care

The textured-hair trap: using routines designed for straighter textures.

## What Usually Fails

- Cleansing frequency that strips moisture
- Heavy products without clarifying cadence
- Heat styling without protection strategy
- Detangling methods that increase breakage

## What Works

- Moisture and hold balance by texture and porosity
- Section-based application for even distribution
- Protective styling with scalp comfort checks
- Clarify on schedule to prevent buildup

## Routine Backbone

1. Cleanse with texture-appropriate frequency
2. Condition and detangle with low-friction method
3. Layer leave-in plus hold according to goal
4. Protect overnight to reduce breakage

## Adjustment Rule

If definition drops or scalp comfort declines, modify one variable first: cleanse cadence, product amount, or hold level.
