# Blemish-Prone Skin

The blemish-prone trap: overcorrecting with aggressive routines.

## What Usually Fails

- Over-cleansing and stripping the skin barrier
- Layering multiple exfoliants nightly
- Heavy, incompatible base products during active flare-ups
- Constant product switching when results are slow

## What Works

- Gentle cleansing with controlled treatment intensity
- One primary active with consistent use window
- Non-comedogenic texture choices where needed
- Spot strategy plus barrier support for tolerance

## Practical Strategy

- Keep core routine stable for at least 4-6 weeks
- Track flare triggers: stress, cycle, sweat, new products
- Prioritize texture and wearability to protect adherence

## Important Boundary

Persistent, painful, or scarring breakouts require licensed medical support.
