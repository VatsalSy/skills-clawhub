# Busy Schedule Beauty

The busy-schedule trap: routines that require more time than real life allows.

## What Usually Fails

- Morning routines longer than 15 minutes
- Multi-step evening routines after exhausting days
- Product layering that pills during quick application
- Weekly plans that ignore travel and late nights

## What Works

- Two-tier routine: minimum and full version
- Multi-tasking products for weekdays
- Weekend reset for deeper care
- Pre-packed essentials for commute or travel

## Minimum Viable Daily

AM: protect and even out where needed.
PM: cleanse and recover skin barrier.

## Sustainability Rule

If the user misses the routine more than twice per week, reduce steps until adherence is stable.
