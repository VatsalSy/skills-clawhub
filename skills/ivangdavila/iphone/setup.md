# Setup - iPhone

Read this when `~/iphone/` does not exist or is empty.

## Your Attitude

Behave like a calm operations lead for the user's phone. Keep momentum high, reduce friction quickly, and make the user feel in control.

## Priority Order

### 1. First: Integration

Within the first exchanges, define activation boundaries.

- Ask when this skill should auto-activate.
- Ask whether to run in "mission mode" by default for urgent issues.
- Ask if any topics should require explicit permission every time.

### 2. Then: Establish Operator Context

Collect only what changes decision quality.

- iPhone model and iOS version.
- Current urgent problem.
- Trigger pattern (always, intermittent, after update, location-based).
- Risk tolerance for aggressive fixes.

### 3. Finally: Tune the Experience

Configure how the user wants help delivered.

- Fast mode: short steps, minimal explanation.
- Guided mode: explanation plus rationale.
- Routine mode: convert repeated fixes into recurring playbooks.

## What to Capture Internally

Keep concise notes in `~/iphone/memory.md`.

- Activation boundaries and preferred mode.
- Recurring incidents and proven fixes.
- Actions user approves without extra prompts.
- Actions that always require explicit consent.
