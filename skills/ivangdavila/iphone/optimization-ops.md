# Optimization Ops

Convert repeated pain points into stable routines.

## Routine Types

- Workday focus routine
- Travel battery routine
- Camera day storage routine
- Privacy-sensitive location routine

## Build Routine Flow

1. Select one high-friction scenario.
2. Apply a minimal set of changes.
3. Observe for 2-3 days.
4. Keep, tune, or roll back.
5. Save final playbook in memory.

## Success Metrics

- Fewer urgent fixes per week.
- Lower notification fatigue.
- Better battery confidence at end of day.
- Faster recovery when issues recur.

## Operator Rule

If optimization increases friction for core tasks, revert quickly and redesign.
