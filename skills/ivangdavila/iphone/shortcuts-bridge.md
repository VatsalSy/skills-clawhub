# Shortcuts Bridge

Use iOS Shortcuts to make mission outcomes reusable.

## High-Value Shortcut Patterns

- Morning focus starter (Focus mode + app launch set)
- Travel saver (Low Power Mode + reduced notifications)
- Night cleanup (open storage review and reminder tasks)
- Connectivity reset prep (open Wi-Fi/Bluetooth panes quickly)

## Build Guidance

1. Define one trigger (time, location, or manual run).
2. Keep each shortcut small and testable.
3. Avoid hidden complexity in first version.
4. Validate behavior for 2-3 runs before scaling.

## Safety Rules

- Never automate destructive actions without confirmation.
- Keep a manual override path.
- Document what each shortcut changes and why.
