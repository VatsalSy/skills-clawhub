# Rewards Optimization

## Types of Rewards

| Type | How it works | Best for |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Cashback** | Statement credit or deposit | Simplicity, guaranteed value |
| **Points** | Redeemable for travel, transfers | Travelers, optimizers |
| **Miles** | Airline-specific | Loyal to one airline |

**When in doubt:** Cashback. No expiration, no devaluation, no effort.

## Basic Optimization

**Match card to category:**
- Groceries → Grocery bonus card
- Gas → Gas bonus card
- Everything else → Best flat-rate card

**Don't overthink it.** Using the "wrong" card loses maybe 1-2%. Not worth stress.

## Signup Bonuses

Most valuable part of credit cards:
- Often worth $500-1000+ in value
- Requires spending threshold (e.g., $4k in 3 months)
- **Only pursue if you'd spend that anyway**

**Timing:** Apply when you have planned large purchases (furniture, travel, etc.)

## Points Valuation

Rough values (can vary):
| Program | Value per point |
|---------|-----------------|
| Chase Ultimate Rewards | 1.5-2¢ |
| Amex Membership Rewards | 1-2¢ |
| Generic cashback | 1¢ (fixed) |

**Transfer partners** can boost value but require more work.

## Shopping Portals

Extra cashback for online shopping:
1. Go to portal (Rakuten, Chase Offers, etc.)
2. Click through to store
3. Make purchase
4. Get extra 1-15% back

**Stacking:** Portal + credit card rewards + store sale = maximum savings.

## Common Mistakes

- **Carrying a balance for rewards** — Interest destroys all reward value
- **Annual fee cards unused** — Downgrade or cancel before renewal
- **Forgetting to activate rotating categories** — Check quarterly
- **Redeeming points for merchandise** — Almost always worst value

## The Simple Approach

1. Get one good cashback card (2%+ everywhere)
2. Use it for everything
3. Pay full balance monthly
4. You're now ahead of 90% of people

Advanced optimization exists but returns diminish quickly.
