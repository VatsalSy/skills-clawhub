# Card Selection Guide

## Category Bonuses Explained

Many cards give extra rewards (3-5%) in specific categories:

| Category | What counts | Common bonus cards |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Groceries | Supermarkets, not Walmart/Target | Amex Gold, Blue Cash |
| Dining | Restaurants, takeout, bars | Chase Sapphire, Amex Gold |
| Gas | Gas stations only | Costco, various rotating |
| Travel | Airlines, hotels, car rental | Chase Sapphire, Amex Platinum |
| Online shopping | Amazon, general e-commerce | Amazon card, Discover (rotating) |

**Rotating categories:** Some cards (Chase Freedom, Discover It) change bonus categories quarterly. Check and activate each quarter.

## The Simple Setup

If you only want to remember one rule:
- **One card for everything:** Pick your highest flat-rate cashback (2%+)
- Use it everywhere, don't think about it
- That's 80% of the benefit with 0% of the effort

## Choosing Between Cards

**At checkout, ask:**
1. Is this a bonus category on any of my cards?
   - Yes → Use that card
   - No → Use default high-cashback card
2. Is this international?
   - Yes → Use no-foreign-fee card
3. Large purchase needing protection?
   - Yes → Credit card (not debit)

## "Credit or Debit?" at Checkout

When your debit card asks this:
- **Credit:** Uses Visa/MC network, may offer more protection
- **Debit:** Uses PIN, pulls directly from bank
- **Either works** for debit cards — but "credit" often has better fraud protection

## Credit Utilization

Keep balances below 30% of credit limit:
- $10,000 limit → Keep balance under $3,000
- High utilization hurts credit score
- Pay down before statement closes if needed

## Foreign Transaction Fees

Cards with no foreign fees (partial list):
- Chase Sapphire (Preferred/Reserve)
- Capital One (most cards)
- Discover (no fee, but less accepted abroad)

Cards that DO charge 3% foreign fee:
- Most bank-issued cards
- Many store cards

**Always pay in local currency** when asked — "pay in USD" = worse exchange rate.
