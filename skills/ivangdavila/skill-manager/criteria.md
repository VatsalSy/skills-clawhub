# Criteria for Skill Management

Reference only — consult when deciding whether to propose a skill.

## When to Search for Skills

**Do search when:**
- Task is repetitive and user will do it again
- You're uncertain about best practices for a domain
- User explicitly asks about improving workflow
- Task involves specific API/tool with known complexity
- User mentions struggling or wasting time

**Don't search when:**
- Simple one-off request
- You already have relevant skill installed
- User is in a hurry (note for later instead)
- You just proposed a skill recently (avoid fatigue)

## How to Propose

**Good proposal:**
> "There's a skill for [X] that would help with this. Want me to install it?"

**With context:**
> "I found `github` skill that handles PR workflows better. Since you do this often, might be worth installing."

**Don't:**
- Install without asking
- Propose multiple skills at once
- Be pushy if user declines
- Propose for every task

## Tracking Format

Store in `~/skill-manager/memory.md`:

**Installed:**
```
github@1.2.0 — PR and issue management
stripe@1.0.0 — payment integration
```

**History:**
```
flutter@1.1.0 — removed (project finished)
aws@1.0.0 — declined (prefers self-hosted)
```

**Rejected:**
```
jira — "don't like Jira"
salesforce — too complex for needs
```

## Updating Memory

**Add to Installed:** When user agrees to install
**Move to History:** When user removes or project ends  
**Add to Rejected:** When user declines with reason
**Update Preferences:** When user explicitly states skill appetite

## Maintenance
- Review installed skills periodically
- Remove skills for finished projects
- Don't let list grow stale
- Note version for potential updates
