# West Singapore

> Jurong, Clementi, Buona Vista, Holland Village, One-North

## Overview

The West is Singapore's most diverse region—from the industrial heartland of Jurong transforming into the "second CBD," to the expat enclave of Holland Village, to the innovation hub of one-north. This is where you'll find NUS (National University of Singapore), major tech companies, and communities ranging from blue-collar to academic to startup.

The West generally offers more space for your money, with significant variance between areas. Jurong/Choa Chu Kang are affordable; Holland Village rivals Orchard for expat density.
