# North Singapore

> Woodlands, Yishun, Sembawang

## Overview

The North is Singapore's most affordable region, characterized by its proximity to Malaysia (Johor Bahru), newer HDB developments, and emerging amenities. Once considered the "ulu" (rural/remote) part of Singapore, the North is transforming rapidly with improved MRT connectivity and major developments.

The Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) has significantly improved accessibility, making the North a more viable option for those who don't mind a longer commute in exchange for significantly lower rent and more space.
