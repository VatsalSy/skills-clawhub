# Central Suburbs

> Novena, Toa Payoh, Bishan, Ang Mo Kio

## Overview

The central suburbs represent the "Goldilocks zone" of Singapore living—not as expensive as Orchard, not as far as the northern or western suburbs, and with excellent MRT connectivity. These are mature HDB towns with strong community identities, good schools, and everything you need within reach.

This is where many Singaporean families aspire to live: central enough for quick CBD commutes, affordable enough to actually own property, and established enough to have character and amenities.
