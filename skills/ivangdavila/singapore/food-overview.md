# Singapore Food Scene Overview

## A Food Lover's Paradise

Singapore is one of the world's great food destinations, where culinary traditions from China, India, Malaysia, and beyond have converged and evolved over nearly two centuries. The city-state's food culture is so significant that **hawker culture was inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in December 2020** — Singapore's first UNESCO recognition.

## Hawker Centres: The Heart of Singapore Food

### UNESCO Heritage Recognition
Singapore's hawker culture was officially recognized by UNESCO on 16 December 2020 after a two-year nomination process led by the National Heritage Board (NHB), National Environment Agency (NEA), and Federation of Merchants' Associations.

The nomination highlighted hawker centres as:
- **"Community dining rooms"** where people from diverse backgrounds gather
- Markers of Singapore's multicultural identity (Chinese, Malay, Indian, and other cultures)
- Living repositories of culinary heritage, with some hawkers practicing since the 1960s
- Spaces that promote social interaction and strengthen community bonds

### What is a Hawker Centre?
Hawker centres evolved from street food vendors in the 19th century who fed the migrant laborers building Singapore. Today, over **110 hawker centres** serve as communal dining spaces across the island.

**Key characteristics:**
- Open-air or covered communal eating spaces
- Individual stall operators (hawkers) each specializing in 1-2 dishes
- Self-service seating (find a table, order from stalls, return trays)
- Extremely affordable prices ($3-8 per dish)
- No reservations, no dress code
