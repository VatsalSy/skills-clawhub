# Orchard Road & Newton

> Singapore's premier shopping district and upscale residential enclave

## Overview

Orchard Road is Singapore's most famous address—a 2.2km shopping paradise lined with malls, luxury brands, and international hotels. Living here means being at the heart of retail therapy, with easy access to everything Singapore offers. Newton and the surrounding areas provide a slightly quieter residential experience while maintaining premium status.

This is **District 9** (Orchard, River Valley) and parts of **District 10** (Tanglin, Bukit Timah) and **District 11** (Newton, Novena)—Singapore's prime residential districts with the highest proportion of expats.
