4. **Family situation?** (Single, couple, kids, what ages?)
5. **What lifestyle matters most?** (Nightlife, food, nature, community)
6. **Expat community or local immersion?**

## Special Situations

### On a Corporate Package
If your company provides housing allowance:
- Check if they have **approved districts** (some only cover D9/10/11)
- Negotiate **lease terms** - 2-year minimum common
- Ask about **diplomatic clauses** for early termination
- Consider **serviced apartments** for first 3-6 months

### Short-Term (< 1 year)
- **Serviced apartments** - More flexible, no long lease
- **Co-living** - Lyf, Hmlet, The Ascott
- **CBD/Orchard** - Easiest transition, but expensive
- Avoid long commute areas - Not worth it for short stay

### With Children in International Schools
| School | Best Living Areas |
|--------|-------------------|
| UWCSEA (Dover) | Clementi, Buona Vista, Holland V |
| UWCSEA (East) | Tampines, Bedok, East Coast |
| Tanglin Trust | Holland V, Bukit Timah, Orchard |
| SAS | Woodlands (they provide bus) |
| SJI International | Bishan, Thomson, Novena |
| Australian Int'l | Orchard, Newton, Holland V |

### Working from Home
If commute doesn't matter:
- **Maximize space** - Suburbs offer larger units
- **Prioritize internet** - Fiber everywhere, but check
- **Consider lifestyle** - What will you do after work?
- **Co-working nearby** - Many areas have options

Best WFH areas: East Coast (lifestyle), Bishan (central but spacious), Punggol (new, modern)
