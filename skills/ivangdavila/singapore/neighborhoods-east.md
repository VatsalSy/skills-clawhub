# East Singapore

> Katong, Marine Parade, East Coast, Bedok, Tampines

## Overview

The East is where Singapore's laid-back, lifestyle-oriented living thrives. Famous for its Peranakan heritage, beach park, excellent food, and strong community feel, the East offers a distinctly different vibe from the CBD or Orchard. This is where expats and locals mix naturally, united by a love of good food, outdoor activities, and a more relaxed pace.

The East spans from the more central Marine Parade through the suburban heartlands of Bedok, Tampines, and beyond. Property prices vary significantly depending on proximity to the coast and MRT access.

## Thomson-East Coast Line Impact

The **TEL** has transformed the East! New stations (opened 2024):
- Marine Parade
- Marine Terrace  
- Katong Park
- Tanjong Katong
- Siglap
- Bayshore

**Result**: Previously car-dependent areas now have direct MRT access. Property values have increased, especially around new stations. Commute times to CBD reduced by 10-15 minutes.

## Rental Market Tips

1. **Katong shophouses** - Charming but check for noise, pests, maintenance
2. **Sea view premium** - Worth it for some, not for others; consider 20-30% markup
3. **New TEL stations** - Properties near them have appreciated
4. **Bedok** - Best value in the East, often overlooked by expats
5. **Older condos** - May have larger units but dated facilities
6. **HDB near parks** - Great family option if not bound by expat lease rules
