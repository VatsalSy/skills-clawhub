## Local Schools: MOE System

### Primary Education (Compulsory)

**Foundation Stage (P1-P4):**
- Core subjects: English, Mother Tongue, Mathematics
- Science added from P3
- Other: Art, Music, PE, Civics, Social Studies

**Orientation Stage (P5-P6):**
- Subject-based banding by ability
- Preparation for PSLE

### The PSLE: Singapore's Most Stressful Exam

**Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)**
- Taken at age 12 (end of Primary 6)
- Subjects: English, Mother Tongue, Mathematics, Science
- Results determine secondary school placement
- National exam creates enormous pressure

**PSLE Scoring System (Post-2021 Reform)**
- Achievement Levels (AL): 1-8 per subject (1 is best)
- Total score: 4-32 (lower is better)
- Replaced T-score system to reduce pressure (debatable success)

**Why PSLE Matters So Much:**
- Entry to top secondary schools
- Streaming into Express, Normal Academic, or Normal Technical
- Perceived as setting life trajectory
- Parents hire multiple tutors from Primary 3 onwards

### Secondary Education Streams

| Stream | Duration | Exam | University Path |
|--------|----------|------|-----------------|
| **Express** | 4 years | O-Levels | JC → A-Levels → University |
| **Normal Academic** | 5 years | N(A) → O-Levels | Poly/ITE → may progress |
| **Normal Technical** | 4 years | N(T)-Levels | ITE → may progress |
| **Integrated Programme (IP)** | 6 years | IB/A-Levels | Direct to university track |

### Top Local Schools (Highly Competitive)

**Primary Schools (Popular):**

- Anglo-Chinese School (Primary)
- Catholic High School (Primary)

**Secondary Schools:**
