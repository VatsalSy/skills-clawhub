## 11. The Philosophy Behind It

### Why So Strict?
Singapore's laws reflect:
1. **Small size:** Must maintain order in 5.6M people on tiny island
2. **Multi-racial society:** Harsh sedition laws prevent conflict
3. **Economic focus:** Clean, safe = business-friendly
4. **Paternalistic government:** State knows best philosophy
5. **Historical trauma:** Racial riots (1964) → racial harmony laws

### The Trade-off
- **Pros:** Extremely safe, clean, efficient
- **Cons:** Limited personal freedoms, expression

### Living With It
Most residents (including expats) appreciate the trade-off:
- Children can play outside safely
- Women can walk alone at 3 AM
- Property crime is extremely rare
- Public spaces are immaculate

Just follow the rules, and Singapore is paradise. Break them, and penalties are severe.
