1. **B2B over B2C**: Enterprise sales often easier than consumer
2. **Regional mindset**: Build for ASEAN from day 1
3. **Government relationships**: Leverage grants and partnerships

5. **Multicultural team**: Helps with regional expansion
6. **Pragmatic approach**: Singapore values execution over hype

2. **Small local market**: 6M population, need regional ambition
3. **EP constraints**: COMPASS makes hiring foreigners harder
4. **Compliance overhead**: Heavy on documentation
5. **Ignoring local talent**: Locals know the market better

### Tips for Foreign Founders

1. **Visit first**: Network before committing
2. **Find local co-founder**: Helps with EP/EntrePass, market knowledge
