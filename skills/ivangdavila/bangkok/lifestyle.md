# Bangkok Expat Lifestyle

Bangkok hosts one of Asia's largest expat communities — estimates range from 300,000-500,000 foreigners living in the city. This creates a parallel world where you can live entirely in English, eat Western food, and barely interact with Thai culture, or you can fully immerse.
