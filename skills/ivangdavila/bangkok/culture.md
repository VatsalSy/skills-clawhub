# Thai Culture & Customs

## Core Concepts

### Sanuk (Fun)

Thai culture values enjoyment in everything — work, relationships, daily life. If it's not sanuk, why do it?

**What This Means**:
- Thais prefer light-hearted interactions
- Heavy seriousness is avoided
- Work should have fun elements
- Celebrations are important

### Face (Sia Naa)

Losing face = public embarrassment. Causing someone to lose face is a serious offense.

**What This Means**:
- Never criticize publicly
- Don't argue aggressively
- Avoid confrontation
- Praise privately
- Errors are addressed indirectly

### Greng Jai

Reluctance to impose on others or cause inconvenience.

**What This Means**:
- Thais may not tell you the truth to avoid confrontation
- "Yes" doesn't always mean yes
- Problems may be hidden to not burden you
- Offers may be declined initially out of politeness

### Mai Pen Rai

"It doesn't matter" / "no worries" / "let it go"

**What This Means**:
- Don't stress over small things
- Flexibility over rigid rules
- Patience is valued
- Accept what can't be changed

## Monarchy & Religion

### The Royal Family

**Critical Rule**: Never disrespect the monarchy.

- **Lèse-majesté law**: 3-15 years prison per offense
- **Actively enforced**: People have been jailed for social media posts
- **Stand for anthem**: Before movies, at train stations
- **Don't step on money**: King's image is on currency
- **Respect images**: King's photos are everywhere

**What To Do**:
- Stand when anthem plays
- Never criticize (even in private conversations)
- Show respect at royal-related sites

### Buddhism

Thailand is 95% Buddhist. It permeates daily life.

**Monks**:
- Highly respected
- Women cannot touch monks
- Don't hand things directly to monks
- Give way to monks on sidewalks
- Morning alms giving is important ritual

**Temples**:
- Remove shoes before entering
- Dress modestly (shoulders and knees covered)
- Don't point feet at Buddha images
- Don't climb on Buddha statues
- Photography restrictions in some areas

## Body Language & Etiquette

### The Head

**Sacred**: The head is the most sacred part of the body.

- Don't touch anyone's head (including children)
- Don't pass objects over someone's head
- Lower your head when passing in front of elders/monks

### The Feet

**Lowest/unclean**: Feet are the lowest part of the body.

- Never point feet at people, Buddha images, or temples
- Don't step over people
- Don't use feet to point or move things
- Remove shoes when entering homes and temples

### The Wai

The traditional Thai greeting — palms pressed together, slight bow.

**When to Wai**:
- Return a wai when given (always)
- Greeting elders/superiors
- Saying thank you
- At temples

**When NOT to Wai**:
- To children (they wai first)
- To service staff (they wai first)
- While holding things (nod instead)

**How High**:
- Equals: Fingers at chest
- Elders/superiors: Fingers at chin
- Monks: Fingers at forehead
- Buddha: Fingers at forehead + bow

### Physical Contact

- Public displays of affection: Keep minimal
- Handshakes: Acceptable in business, wai more traditional
- Same-sex friends: Hand holding/linking arms common (not romantic)
- Hugging: Not traditional, more accepted now in cities

## Social Hierarchy

Thai society has clear hierarchies based on:
- **Age**: Elders respected
- **Status**: Wealth, position, education
- **Profession**: Some roles carry automatic respect

**What This Means**:
- Use proper titles and pronouns
- Defer to elders in conversations
- Senior people served first
- Don't contradict superiors publicly

## Communication Style

### Indirect Communication

Thais avoid direct confrontation.

- "Maybe" often means "no"
- "Difficult" may mean "impossible"
- Silence can indicate disagreement
- Problems addressed through hints

### Saving Face

- Don't publicly embarrass anyone
- Praise in public, criticize in private
- Accept that some "yes" responses are politeness
- Don't force confrontations

### Tone

- Keep voice calm
- Anger is loss of face
- Shouting = serious loss of control
- Smile even when uncomfortable

## Daily Life Customs

### Entering Homes

- Remove shoes (always)
- May be offered slippers
- Lower body when passing elders

### Eating

- Shared dishes are normal
- Use spoon (main utensil) and fork
- Chopsticks for noodle soups only
- Take small portions, go back for more
- Don't finish everything (shows you're full)

### Gift Giving

- Wrap nicely
- Gifts often not opened in front of giver
- Quality over quantity
- Avoid black wrapping paper

### Dress

- Modest in temples and government buildings
- Business: Conservative, formal
- Casual: Acceptable in most places
