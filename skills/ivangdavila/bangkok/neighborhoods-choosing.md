## Common Mistakes

### "I'll stay near Khao San to save money"
- **Reality**: You save ฿3,000/month but lose hours daily in taxis
- **Better**: On Nut is cheap AND has BTS access

### "Thonglor is where everyone goes"
- **Reality**: Thonglor is expensive and you're paying for hype
- **Better**: Ekkamai or Ari have same vibe, 30% cheaper

### "I'll be near work in Silom"
- **Reality**: Silom is dead on weekends, no neighborhood feel
- **Better**: Live on Sukhumvit, 10-min BTS to Silom

### "Riverside hotels look beautiful"
- **Reality**: Isolated, taxi-dependent for everything except temples
- **Better**: Stay 2-3 nights for experience, not as base

### "Nana is central and cheap"
- **Reality**: Red light district, sleaze everywhere
- **Better**: Asok is one stop away, much nicer

---

## Neighborhood Compatibility

### Great Combinations
- **Live On Nut** + work Silom = 25-min BTS, save money
- **Live Ari** + weekends Chatuchak = walk to market
- **Live Thonglor** + nightlife = everything walkable
- **Live Asok** + exploring = central to everywhere

### Bad Combinations
- **Live Riverside** + work Sukhumvit = nightmare commute
- **Live Khao San** + anywhere = taxi hell
- **Live Sathorn** + nightlife = expensive Grabs home

## Rent Negotiation Tips

### When You Have Leverage
- **Low season (April-October)**: Negotiate 10-20% off
- **Long-term commitment (6+ months)**: Negotiate monthly rate
- **Direct from owner (Facebook, LINE)**: Skip agent fees

### Standard Terms
- **Deposit**: 2 months (refundable if no damage)
- **Payment**: Monthly in advance
- **Utilities**: Electricity ~฿7/unit (50% markup is normal)
- **Internet**: Often included or ฿500-1,000/month
- **Minimum**: Usually 6 months (negotiate 3)

### Where to Find
- **Hipflat.co.th**: Best for condos
- **DDProperty**: Good selection
- **Facebook groups**: Bangkok Expats, Digital Nomads Bangkok
- **Property agents**: Take one month fee
- **Walk around**: Many buildings have rental office

---

## First Week Strategy

### If Unsure Where to Live
1. **Book 3-5 nights** in Asok area (central, transit hub)
2. **Take BTS everywhere**: Get feel for commute times
3. **Walk neighborhoods**: Spend an afternoon in each candidate
4. **Check condos in person**: Photos lie, see units

### What to Evaluate
- BTS station distance (Google Maps walking time)
- Nearest supermarket (7-11 isn't enough)
- Noise level (visit at night)
- Building security and maintenance
- Actual internet speed (ask to test)
- Air conditioning age/condition

## The Golden Rule

**Live where you'll spend time, not where you work.**

Bangkok's BTS means work commute is 20-30 minutes from anywhere central. Choose your neighborhood for after-work life, weekends, and daily happiness — not to minimize work commute by 5 minutes.
