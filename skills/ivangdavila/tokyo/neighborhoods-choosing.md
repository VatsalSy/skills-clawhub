# Choosing Your Tokyo Neighborhood

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Determine Your Priority

**What matters most to you?**

| Priority | Best Areas |
|----------|------------|
| Short commute | Near workplace or on same line |
| Low rent | Nerima, Adachi, Edogawa, outer Suginami |
| Nightlife | Shibuya, Shinjuku, Roppongi |
| Family life | Setagaya, Meguro, Kichijoji |
| International community | Minato (Hiroo, Azabu), Shibuya |
| Traditional atmosphere | Asakusa, Yanaka, Kagurazaka |
| Nature/parks | Kichijoji, Nerima, Setagaya |
| Trendy/hip | Shimokitazawa, Nakameguro, Daikanyama |

### Step 2: Set Your Budget

**Monthly rent you can afford (rule: ≤30% of take-home)**

| Net Monthly Income | Max Rent | Best Areas |
|--------------------|----------|------------|
| ¥250,000 | ¥75,000 | Nerima, Adachi, Edogawa |
| ¥350,000 | ¥105,000 | Nakano, Suginami, Koto |
| ¥450,000 | ¥135,000 | Meguro, Setagaya, Shibuya outskirts |
| ¥600,000+ | ¥180,000+ | Central Shibuya, Minato |

### Step 3: Map Your Commute

**Find your workplace station, then:**

1. Identify which train lines serve it
2. Look for residential areas along those lines
3. Calculate commute time (aim for ≤45min door-to-door)
4. Check rent levels at candidate stations

**Commute Time Sweet Spots:**
- 10-15min from work: Premium pricing, very convenient
- 20-30min from work: Good balance of value and convenience
- 30-45min from work: Best value, still manageable
- 45min+: Consider if savings are worth time cost

## Practical Checklist

Before signing a lease, verify:

### Transit
- [ ] Walk time to nearest station (<10min ideal)
- [ ] Number of train lines available
- [ ] Direct line to workplace?
- [ ] Last train time

### Daily Life
- [ ] Supermarket within walking distance
- [ ] Convenience store nearby (24/7)
- [ ] Clinic/hospital accessibility
- [ ] Parks or green space

### Building
- [ ] Building age (newer = earthquake safe)
- [ ] Floor level (higher = quieter, more sun)
- [ ] Laundry (in-unit vs shared)
- [ ] Air conditioning (essential for summer)
- [ ] Internet availability (fiber preferred)

### Neighborhood Feel
- [ ] Visit at different times (day, night, weekend)
- [ ] Check noise levels
- [ ] Observe who lives there (families, singles, etc.)
- [ ] Check Google Maps reviews of area

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Prioritizing Rent Over Commute
A ¥20,000/month savings isn't worth an extra hour daily commute. Calculate:
- Extra 1hr/day × 22 days = 22 hours/month
- Is ¥20,000 ÷ 22 hours = ¥909/hour worth your time?

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Move-in Costs
That ¥80,000/month apartment might cost ¥400,000 upfront (5 months equivalent). Budget accordingly.

### Mistake 3: Not Visiting the Area
Photos lie. Always visit:
- Rush hour commute simulation
- Evening/night atmosphere
- Weekend crowd levels
- Rainy day walkability

### Mistake 4: Underestimating Japanese Apartment Sizes
- 20㎡ is small but livable for singles
- 30㎡ is comfortable for singles
- 40㎡+ needed for couples
- 60㎡+ for families

### Mistake 5: Assuming Everywhere Has English Support
Outside Minato ward, assume no English. Prepare:
- Japanese-speaking friend for apartment hunting
- Translation app
- Bilingual real estate agent (higher fees but worth it)
