## Overall Assessment

London is one of the safest major cities globally. Violent crime against tourists is extremely rare. Main concerns are petty theft (pickpocketing, phone snatching) and occasional scams. Exercise normal urban awareness.

**Comparison:** Safer than New York, Paris, or Barcelona for street crime. Less safe than Tokyo or Singapore.

## Crime by Type

### Pickpocketing (Most Common)

| Hotspots | How It Happens | Prevention |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Oxford Street | Crowds, distraction | Front pocket, zipped bag |
| Tube (Central, Piccadilly lines) | Rush hour crush | Secure bags, be aware |
| Borough Market | Food distractions | Cross-body bags |
| Westminster Bridge | Photo-taking | Never put phone in back pocket |
| Camden Market | Browsing mode | Keep valuables secure |

### Phone Snatching (Rising Concern)

| Distraction grab | Asking for directions | Brief interaction, phone in pocket |

**Note:** Apple/Samsung "Find My" + theft protection features are essential.

### Knife Crime (Context)

- Almost entirely gang-related, in specific areas
- Does NOT affect tourists in tourist areas
- Media overhypes compared to actual risk to visitors
- Areas of concern (for residents, not tourists): parts of Hackney, Newham, Haringey, Lambeth

### Scams (Tourist-Targeting)

| Scam | How It Works | Response |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Charity clipboard** | Sign petition → asks for donation, card skimming | Say "no thanks," walk on |
| **CD handout** | "Free CD" → demands payment, gets aggressive | Don't accept anything |
| **Shell game** | Street gambling game → rigged, you always lose | Never participate, crowds are shills |
| **Fake flower sellers** | Forces flower on you → demands payment | Firmly refuse, keep walking |
| **"Wrong change"** | Claims you didn't pay enough | Count change immediately |
| **ATM helpers** | Offers to help at ATM → shoulder surfing | Politely decline all help |
| **Fake tickets** | Theatre/attraction tickets outside venues | Only buy from official box office or TKTS |
| **Taxi overcharge** | Refuses meter, quotes inflated price | Only use black cabs (meter) or Uber |
