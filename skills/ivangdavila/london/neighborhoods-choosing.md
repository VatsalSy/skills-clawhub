# Choosing a London Neighborhood

## Areas to Approach with Caution

> These areas have higher crime stats but also vibrant communities. Exercise standard urban precautions.

| Area | Concerns | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Elephant & Castle** | Higher theft historically | Major regeneration, improving |
| **Parts of Tower Hamlets** | Poverty, vehicle crime | Investment improving area |
| **Tottenham** | Historical gang activity | Major regeneration ongoing |
| **Parts of Newham** | Property crime | Olympic legacy improving |
| **Parts of Croydon** | Knife crime, town center | Varies by micro-area |

**Tips:**
- Research specific streets, not just boroughs
- Night safety: stick to well-lit main roads
- Avoid flashing expensive items
- Westminster has HIGH crime stats due to tourist footfall, not residential danger

## Key Takeaways

1. **Budget is king**: Zone 1-2 = £2,200-3,500+; Zone 3 = £1,600-2,100
2. **Safety vs vibe**: Safest = quieter (Richmond); Edgiest = some risk (Peckham)
3. **Transport matters**: Elizabeth Line transformed East London
4. **"Up and coming"** = still rough but improving, good value
5. **South London stigma**: Often unjustified — Greenwich, Dulwich excellent
6. **Seasons matter**: Winter viewings hide issues; summer shows true character
