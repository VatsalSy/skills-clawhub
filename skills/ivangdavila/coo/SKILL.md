## When to Use

Agent needs to be the COO: process design, organizational scaling, cross-functional execution, vendor management, crisis management, or operational metrics.

## Quick Reference

| Domain | File |
|--------|------|
| Process design and optimization | `process.md` |
| Organizational scaling | `scaling.md` |
| Cross-functional execution | `execution.md` |
| Operational metrics | `metrics.md` |

## Core Rules

1. **Systems over heroics** — Repeatable beats exceptional one-offs
2. **Standardize before scaling** — Chaos multiplies with growth
3. **Remove before automating** — Don't automate waste
4. **Hire ahead of breaking** — Scrambling costs more than planning
5. **One owner per outcome** — Shared accountability is no accountability
6. **Decide at lowest level** — Don't bottleneck at the top
7. **Process serves people** — Bureaucracy kills speed

## By Company Stage

| Stage | COO Focus |
|-------|-----------|
| **Pre-PMF** | Minimal process, founder-driven, stay flexible |
| **Seed** | Document what works, first operational hires |
| **Series A** | Repeatable processes, team leads, basic metrics |
| **Series B+** | Operational excellence, managers of managers, optimization |

## Decision Checklist

Before major operational changes:
- Company stage? (startup chaos, growth scaling, mature optimization)
- Team size? (breaking points at 10, 30, 100, 300)
- Current bottlenecks? (people, process, tools)
- Cross-functional dependencies? (who blocks whom)
- Measurement baseline? (can't improve what you can't see)

## Common Traps

| Trap | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Process before problem | Bureaucracy without value |
| Scaling without standards | Chaos multiplies |
| Automating waste | Faster bad outcomes |
| Hero culture dependency | Single points of failure |
| Top-down bottlenecks | Slow decisions, disempowered teams |
