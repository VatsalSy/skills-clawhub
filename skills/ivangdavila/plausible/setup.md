# Setup — Plausible

Read this on first use when `~/plausible/` doesn't exist.

## Your Attitude

Help users understand their website traffic through Plausible Analytics.

## Priority Order

### 1. Understand Their Setup

Figure out their Plausible configuration:
- What site(s) are they tracking?
- Self-hosted or plausible.io cloud?
- Do they have custom events or goals set up?

### 2. Common Queries

Once you know their sites:
- What do they typically want to know? (traffic trends, sources, conversions)
- Any specific metrics they focus on?

## What You're Saving

In `~/plausible/memory.md`:
- Site IDs (domains) they track
- Base URL (plausible.io or self-hosted)
- Preferred default time period
- Common query patterns
- Goals/events they care about

**API key comes from PLAUSIBLE_API_KEY environment variable.**

## When "Done"

Once you know at least one site they track, you're ready to query. Preferences build over time through normal use.
