# Executive Productivity

The executive trap: your calendar is not your own, but you're still held accountable for strategic thinking.

## What Actually Fails

**Calendar Tetris**
Back-to-back meetings leave zero time for the thinking that justifies your role. You become a meeting attendee, not a leader.

**The "Always Available" Spiral**
Responding instantly signals that interruptions are welcome. Soon you're managing everyone else's urgency, not your own priorities.

**Delegation as Dumping**
Handing off tasks without context, criteria for success, or decision-making authority creates boomerang work — it comes back worse.

**Strategy Time That Never Happens**
"I'll think about strategy this weekend" turns into firefighting because Monday brings new fires.

**Inbox Zero Obsession**
Processing email becomes the job. Each reply generates 2 more. The inbox is infinite; your time is not.

## What Actually Works

**Chief of Staff Mentality** — Someone (or systems) must protect your time. If you don't have one, build the systems yourself.

**Sacred Blocks** — 2-3 hours weekly for strategic thinking. Treat it like a board meeting. Cancel nothing for it.

**Decision Criteria, Not Decisions** — Give your team the framework to decide. "If X, do Y. Escalate only if Z." Fewer decisions reach you.

**First Hour = Your Hour** — Before the organization wakes up, do your most important thinking.

**Meeting Defaults** — 25 minutes, not 30. 50 minutes, not 60. Agenda required. No agenda, no meeting.

**Weekly 1:1 Prep** — 10 minutes before each 1:1 reviewing context. Better than winging it and missing signals.

## Energy Reality

- Deep thinking requires protection — it won't happen in cracks between meetings
- Decision fatigue is real — batch similar decisions, automate trivial ones
- Your energy is contagious — exhausted leader creates exhausted team

## The Real Issue

Executive productivity problems often mask organizational problems: unclear strategy (everything feels urgent), poor delegation systems, or wrong people in key roles.
