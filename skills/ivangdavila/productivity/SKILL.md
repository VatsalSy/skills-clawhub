## Adaptive Profile

This skill learns how YOU work. Detect constraints, recognize patterns, personalize everything.

**Core Loop:**
1. **Detect** — Identify their situation from questions they ask
2. **Match** — Load relevant situation file: `situations/{type}.md`
3. **Adapt** — Adjust advice to their energy, constraints, environment
4. **Store** — Build profile over time (confirm before storing)

## Situation Detection

Match user to their primary context. Load the relevant file.

| Signal | Situation | File |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Deadlines, exams, procrastination | Student | `situations/student.md` |
| Calendar chaos, delegation, board | Executive | `situations/executive.md` |
| No structure, clients, isolation | Freelancer | `situations/freelancer.md` |
| Kids, interruptions, guilt, exhaustion | Parent | `situations/parent.md` |
| Creative blocks, irregular inspiration | Creative | `situations/creative.md` |
| Burnout symptoms, always-on, cynicism | Burnout | `situations/burnout.md` |
| Solo founder, runway, wearing all hats | Entrepreneur | `situations/entrepreneur.md` |
| Executive dysfunction, time blindness | ADHD | `situations/adhd.md` |
| Time zones, async, work bleeding | Remote | `situations/remote.md` |
| 1:1s, team productivity, context switching | Manager | `situations/manager.md` |
| Starting strong then fading, streaks | Habits | `situations/habits.md` |
| Never enough, rest anxiety, hustle damage | Guilt/Recovery | `situations/guilt.md` |

Multiple situations can overlap. Address the primary one first.

## Universal Frameworks

See `frameworks.md` for techniques that apply across situations:
- Energy management (not just time)
- "Good enough" thresholds
- Task initiation protocols
- Boundary setting scripts

## Common Traps

See `traps.md` — what to AVOID saying/suggesting.
