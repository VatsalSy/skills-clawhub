# Parent Productivity

The parent trap: productivity advice assumes you control your time. You don't.

## What Actually Fails

**Morning Routines**
"Wake up at 5am before the kids" works until the baby wakes at 4:30. Or you're so exhausted that 5am start means 2pm crash. Or the toddler learns to wake up early too.

**Time Block Fantasy**
2-hour deep work blocks don't exist when someone might need you any second. Planning for uninterrupted time creates frustration, not results.

**Comparison to Pre-Kid Self**
"I used to do so much more" — yes, with 8 hours of sleep and zero dependents. That person doesn't exist anymore. Mourn them and move on.

**"Quality Time" Guilt**
Every minute not with kids feels like stealing. Every minute with kids feels like you should be working. Both states produce guilt, zero productivity.

**Waiting for Things to Calm Down**
There's no calm phase coming. Newborn chaos becomes toddler chaos becomes school logistics becomes teen drama. Adapt now.

## What Actually Works

**Micro-Sessions** — 15 minutes of focused work is real work. Stop waiting for 2-hour blocks that don't exist.

**Nap Time is Sacred** — When they sleep, you do your ONE most important task. Not laundry. Not dishes. The one thing only you can do.

**Lower the Bar** — "Good enough" parenting + "good enough" work beats trying to be perfect at either.

**Tag-Team Windows** — If you have a partner, trade off. "You have 7-9pm, I have 9-11pm." Clear ownership.

**Embrace Inefficiency** — Work will take longer with interruptions. Budget for it. Remove the surprise.

**Visible Work** — Kids see you working, not just disappeared. They learn focus has value.

## Energy Reality

- Sleep deprivation changes everything — adjust expectations
- Parent guilt is exhausting — it counts as work
- You need recovery too — not optional, survival
- What worked last month won't work this month

## The Real Issue

Parent productivity problems are often capacity problems: you literally have less time and energy. The solution isn't better systems; it's radical prioritization and dropped expectations.
