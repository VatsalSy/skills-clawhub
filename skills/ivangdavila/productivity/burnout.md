# Burnout Productivity

The burnout trap: optimizing a system that's already breaking you.

## What Actually Fails

**More Efficiency**
Burnout doesn't need better systems. Adding productivity techniques to burnout is pouring water into a cracked container.

**"Just Push Through"**
The mindset that created burnout cannot fix it. Harder work makes it worse.

**Weekend Recovery**
Two days cannot undo what five days destroy. If you need weekends to survive, the weeks are the problem.

**Vacation as Cure**
A week off doesn't fix systemic overload. You'll return to the same conditions that burned you out.

**Toxic Positivity**
"You got this!" and "Stay positive!" dismiss the real problem. Burnout isn't an attitude issue.

**Guilt About Resting**
"I should be productive" while resting guarantees you never actually rest.

## What Actually Works

**Subtraction, Not Addition** — What can you stop doing? Drop commitments, projects, responsibilities. Empty space heals.

**Minimum Viable Everything** — Good enough is the new excellent. Save your energy for what truly matters (often: nothing right now).

**Physical First** — Sleep, food, movement. Brain fog and exhaustion clear only after body recovers.

**Hard Boundaries** — No email after 6pm. No weekend work. No exceptions. Negotiate explicitly if needed.

**Small Pleasures** — What used to bring joy before burnout? Music, walks, hobbies. Not productive activities — pleasure.

**Time to Recover** — Burnout recovery takes months, not days. Adjust expectations accordingly.

- Exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix
- Detachment, going through motions
- Dreading Monday on Saturday morning
- Physical symptoms: headaches, insomnia, illness

## Energy Reality

- You have less than you think — act accordingly
- Rest feels wrong but is the only fix
- The work will survive without you (and if it won't, that's the problem)

## The Real Issue

Burnout is usually a systemic problem wearing individual clothes. The job demands too much, the boundaries don't exist, the culture is toxic. Productivity tips can't fix broken systems — sometimes the answer is leave.
