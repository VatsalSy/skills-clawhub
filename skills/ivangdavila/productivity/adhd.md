# ADHD Productivity

The ADHD trap: standard productivity advice is written for neurotypical brains.

## What Actually Fails

**"Just Use a Planner"**
Planners work for brains that remember to check them. ADHD brains need external reminders, not silent notebooks.

**"Just Focus"**
Executive dysfunction means "just focusing" is like telling someone with broken legs to "just walk." The hardware doesn't work that way.

**Willpower-Based Systems**
Any system requiring consistent daily willpower will fail. ADHD brains have inconsistent access to motivation.

**Long-Term Thinking**
Deadlines 2 months away don't feel real. Only the immediate triggers action.

**Rigid Routines**
Fixed schedules bore quickly. The ADHD brain craves novelty, not repetition.

## What Actually Works

**External Brain** — Phone alarms, visual reminders, smart speakers, accountability partners. Get cues OUT of your head.

**Body Doubling** — Working alongside someone (in person or virtual) provides external focus that internal systems can't.

**Artificial Deadlines** — Create urgency: work sessions with others, scheduled accountability, public commitments.

**Task Breakdown Extreme** — "Work on project" is too vague. "Open document" is actionable. Smaller than you think.

**Novelty Injection** — New locations, new music, new tools. Use novelty as fuel instead of fighting it.

**Forgive and Restart** — Missed a day? A week? It doesn't matter. Start now. Guilt is the enemy.

**Leverage Hyperfocus** — When hyperfocus arrives, ride it. Cancel everything. These windows are gold.

## Energy Reality

- Interest-based attention, not importance-based
- Time blindness is real — use timers constantly
- Medication helps many — not a moral failing
- Executive function fluctuates — plan for bad days

---

## Emotional Reality

- ADHD often comes with rejection sensitivity
- Shame spirals destroy more than missed tasks
- Self-compassion is a productivity tool

## The Real Issue

ADHD productivity problems are neurological, not moral. The solution isn't trying harder — it's building systems that work WITH the ADHD brain, not against it.
