# Creative Productivity

The creative trap: treating inspiration like a factory output.

## What Actually Fails

**The Pomodoro Lie**
25-minute timers interrupt flow states. When you're finally in the zone, the timer says stop. Creative work doesn't fit neat boxes.

**Daily Word Counts / Output Quotas**
Some days produce 3,000 words of garbage. Some days produce one perfect sentence. Measuring output ignores quality.

**Inspiration Waiting**
"I'll write when I feel inspired" means not writing. Inspiration comes from working, not before it.

**Forcing Morning Routines**
Many creatives work best at 11pm. The "5am creative hour" advice assumes everyone's brain peaks at the same time.

**Treating All Work Equally**
Ideation, drafting, editing, and polishing require different energies. Forcing all in one session produces nothing good.

## What Actually Works

**Start in the Middle** — Don't begin at the beginning. Jump to the scene/section you're most excited about.

**Minimum Viable Touch** — "Open the file and read yesterday's work" is enough to start. Motion creates momentum.

**Long Sessions When Hot** — When flow arrives, cancel everything. 4-hour creative sessions are worth more than 8 half-hour sessions.

**Separate Ideation from Execution** — Brainstorm Monday. Draft Wednesday. Edit Friday. Different modes, different days.

**Walk Away Points** — Stop mid-sentence when you know what comes next. Tomorrow starts easy.

**Input Matches Output** — Consuming great work feeds creating great work. Rest that includes inspiration isn't wasted time.

## Energy Patterns

- Creative peaks are personal — 9am or 2am, find yours
- Editing energy ≠ creating energy — don't mix
- Deadlines help some creatives, destroy others — know yourself
- Recovery is part of the process, not stealing from it

## The Real Issue

Creative productivity problems often mask fear: fear that the work won't be good enough, fear of finishing and being judged, fear that the well will run dry. Address the fear.
