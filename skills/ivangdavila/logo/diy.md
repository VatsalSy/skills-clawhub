# DIY Logo Creation

## When DIY Makes Sense

| Situation | DIY Viability |
|-----------|---------------|
| Testing business idea, not launched yet | ✅ Perfect |
| Side project, personal brand | ✅ Good |
| Budget under $200 | ✅ Only option |
| Funded startup, external stakeholders | ⚠️ Risky |
| Established business rebranding | ❌ Hire professional |

**The honest truth:** DIY logos are fine for early stages. But if investors, press, or enterprise customers will see it, amateur logos cost credibility.

## AI Logo Generators

| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Looka** | Good templates, full brand kit | Generic, recognizable as AI |
| **Brandmark** | Clean results, editable | Limited customization |
| **Logo.com** | Fast, cheap | Very templated |
| **Midjourney/DALL-E** | Creative concepts | Not vector, needs cleanup |
| **Ideogram** | Better text rendering | Still needs vectorization |

**AI workflow:**
1. Generate 20-50 concepts across tools
2. Pick 3-5 directions that feel right
3. Recreate best ones properly in Figma/Illustrator
4. Never use AI output directly (quality/licensing issues)

## Design Tools

| Tool | Best For | Learning Curve |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Figma** | Quick logos, web-first | Low |
| **Canva** | Simple wordmarks, templates | Very low |
| **Illustrator** | Professional vector work | High |
| **Affinity Designer** | Illustrator alternative, one-time cost | Medium |
| **Inkscape** | Free vector editor | Medium |

**Recommended for non-designers:** Figma. Free, vector-based, exports to SVG, huge template community.

## DIY Process

**Step 1: Wordmark first**
Start with just your name in different fonts. Often this is enough.

**Step 2: Font selection**
- Google Fonts: free, safe, good quality
- Use font pairing sites to find combinations
- Avoid: Comic Sans, Papyrus, overused fonts (Lobster, Bebas)

**Step 3: Modifications**
- Adjust letter spacing (usually needs loosening)
- Try removing/modifying one letter
- Connect letters if it feels natural
- Add a simple shape only if it adds meaning

**Step 4: Color**
- Start with one color
- Use color palette generators (Coolors, Adobe Color)
- Test on light and dark backgrounds
- Make sure it works in grayscale

**Step 5: Icon (optional)**
- Only add if genuinely necessary
- Geometric shapes are safest
- Abstract > literal (avoid clipart-style imagery)

## Common DIY Mistakes

1. **Too many ideas in one logo** — pick ONE concept
2. **Using multiple fonts** — one font, maybe two max
3. **Clipart or stock icons** — will look generic
4. **Complex illustrations** — won't scale
5. **Copying trends exactly** — dates quickly
6. **Not testing sizes** — looks good big, illegible small
7. **Skipping black/white test** — color-dependent logos fail

## Quick Wins

**The simplest path to a decent logo:**

1. Pick a clean sans-serif font (Inter, Outfit, Space Grotesk)
2. Type your company name
3. Increase letter spacing 5-10%
4. Try medium or semibold weight
5. Add subtle color (one color, not too bright)
6. Done

This beats 80% of DIY logos that try too hard.

## When to Upgrade

**Signs you've outgrown DIY:**
- Customers mention "looking small" or "unprofessional"
- You're embarrassed showing the logo
- Hiring employees who question the brand
- Preparing for press, funding, or major partnerships

**Upgrade path:**
1. Keep using DIY logo until it matters
2. Save budget for proper rebrand
3. Hire professional when stakes justify cost
4. Treat it as investment, not expense
