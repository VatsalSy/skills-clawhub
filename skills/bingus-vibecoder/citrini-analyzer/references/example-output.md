**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Citrini Research identifies three accelerating defense themes driven by geopolitical chaos and asymmetric warfare evolution:

**1. DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPONS (DEWs)**
The "Star Wars" dream is now reality. High-power lasers have transitioned from prototypes to operational deployment in 2025-2026.

**Key Developments:**
• Israel deploys Iron Beam (first operational laser air defense, Dec 2025)
• UK's DragonFire incinerates 400mph drones (Sept 2025)
• US Navy commits to "laser on every ship" (Jan 2026)
• Economics: $500 drone vs $50K interceptor → lasers cost ~$1/shot

**Investment Thesis - nLight (LASR US):**
• **Only pure-play megawatt-capable DEW company**
• Stock 6x'd from $8.47 (May 2025) to $51 — "just the start"
• Vertically integrated: diodes → fibers → beam combination → weapons systems
• $171M HELSI contract targeting 1MW laser (vs hypersonics) completing 2026
• Supplier to Iron Beam, Golden Dome ($24.4B budget), Navy programs
• Raised $200M (Feb 2026) to scale production ahead of programs of record
• Q3'25: Defense revenue +70% YoY, 41% gross margin (vs 29% prior year)

**Valuation:**
• Current: $2.9B market cap, 11x trailing revenue
• Bull case: 3x upside if A&D growth sustains 40%+ and HELSI validates
• Bear case: 30% downside if growth decelerates to 20-25%
• Risk/reward: 3:1 favors long

**2. SUBSEA DRONES (UUVs)**
Ukraine's Dec 2025 underwater drone strike on Russian submarine in protected Novorossiysk port = game-changer.

**Key Points:**
• Surface drones pushed Russian Black Sea fleet back
• Subsea drones harder to detect than aerial (no radar, requires sonar)
• Major naval bases (US Norfolk) have gaps in physical defenses
• Critical infrastructure (pipelines, cables) increasingly vulnerable
• Spending wave: offensive UUVs + defensive sensors/countermeasures

**Top Plays:**
• **Oceaneering (OII US)** - 60yr subsea robotics experience, largest DoD contract in history (2025), SIIPS guard-dog system for infrastructure protection. **12x P/E, cheapest exposure**
• **Exail Technologies (EXA FP)** - Closest to pure-play integrated systems, <$2B market cap, rapidly growing backlog
• **Kraken Robotics (PNG CN)** - Synthetic Aperture Sonar (higher resolution), SeaPower batteries (picks & shovels)
• Norbit ASA, Kongsberg, Thales, Leonardo DRS also mentioned

**3. GREENLAND & ARCTIC INVESTMENT**
Trump's Greenland push is continuation of decade-long US-China power struggle, not random aggression.

**Strategic Drivers:**
• Northern Sea Route (NSR) open for business - 40% shorter transit, 10-15 days faster
• Russia: 40 icebreakers (8 nuclear). USA: 1 polar heavy icebreaker
• Rare earth minerals (Tanbreez, Kvanefjeld) - breaking Chinese monopoly
• Arctic bases = shortest ICBM route between nuclear powers

**Investment Opportunities:**

*Minerals (speculative, meme-adjacent):*
• **Critical Metals Corp (CRML US)** - Tanbreez rare earths, EXIM funding, State Dept involvement
• **Energy Transition Minerals (ETM AU)** - Kvanefjeld deposit, dumped Chinese partner, hired Ballard Partners lobbying, planning Nasdaq listing
• Amaroq (AMRQ LN) - Active gold mine + germanium/gallium/cadmium projects

*Icebreakers & Infrastructure:*
• **ABB (ABBN SW)** - Azipod propulsion (360° rotating electric motors, lynchpin of modern icebreaker design)
• **Viking Supply Ships (VSSABB SS)** - Most powerful private icebreakers, pivoting from oil services to NSR commercial/military contracts
• Lindblad Expeditions (LIND US) - Arctic tourism ($63.5K/head Northwest Passage tours), Trump headlines driving demand

*Defense:*
• **Kongsberg (KOG NO)** - Owns Patria, owns Nammo, direct exposure to Nordic defense buildup. **Best proxy for European Arctic defense spending**
• BAE, Thales, Leonardo, Airbus - European SAMP/T NG missile defense ($8.5B snub to Raytheon), Type 26 frigates ($13.5B UK-Norway deal)

*Satellites:*
• **Iridium (IRDM US)** - Only true pole-to-pole LEO constellation, backbone of GMDSS for NSR, 25yr DoD relationship, EMSS contract renewal imminent
• **MDA Space (MDA CN)** - Canada's ESCP-P polar satcom, 198 satellites for Telesat, positioned as non-US alternative for Western allies

---

**RISK FACTORS**
• DEW spending wave could disappoint across multiple countries simultaneously (low probability given convergent validation)
• Greenland plays are speculative with massive regulatory/development hurdles
• "Headline beta" - significant volatility around Trump/geopolitics news flow

**CONCLUSION**
Modern warfare asymmetry (cheap drones vs expensive legacy systems) + geopolitical fracture + fiscal primary shift toward defense = multi-year tailwind. Citrini's "ripped from headlines" approach continues to work. DEWs transitioning from prototype to production. Subsea domain opening. Arctic competition accelerating.
