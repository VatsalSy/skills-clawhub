# Three-Dimensional Memory System

> **Find any file in 10 seconds. Guaranteed.**

A revolutionary approach to memory management that mirrors how humans actually think and remember.

## The Problem

```
Traditional file systems:
📁 Documents/
  📄 report.pdf
  📄 presentation.pptx
📁 Images/
  🖼️ screenshot.png
📁 Other/
  ❓ Where did I save that important thing?
```

**You**: "Where's that pricing strategy we discussed last week?"

**Traditional**: [5 minutes of searching...] "Found it in Documents/Projects/2026/Q1/Pricing/Final/"

## The Solution

```
Three-Dimensional Memory:

memory/                 ← WHEN
  2026-02-21.md        "Product strategy meeting"
  2026-02-22.md        "Drafted pricing proposal"
  2026-02-23.md        "Finalized three-tier model"

AI-memory-backup/       ← WHAT WAS SAID
  backup-20260221.md   "Let's consider three tiers..."
  backup-20260222.md   "$29 might signal cheap..."
  backup-20260223.md   "Final decision: $39, $99, $299"

topic-memory/           ← WHAT IT'S ABOUT
  project-product-launch/
    pricing-strategy.md
    timeline.md
    key-decisions.md
```

**You**: "Where's that pricing strategy?"

**3D Memory**: "You mean the one from Wednesday's meeting? It's in `topic-memory/project-product-launch/pricing-strategy.md`"

**Time to find**: 10 seconds ⏱️

## Installation

```bash
clawhub install three-dimensional-memory
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize the structure
memory-init

# Create today's log
memory-daily "Shipped v2.0, fixed 3 critical bugs"

# Start a new project
memory-project "Q3-Roadmap" --status "planning"

# Search all dimensions
memory-search "pricing"
```

## How It Works

### Dimension 1: Timeline
Humans remember **when** things happened.

Your AI writes a daily work log:
- What was done
- Decisions made
- Meetings held

### Dimension 2: Conversation  
Humans remember **what was said**.

Complete conversation transcripts:
- Every word exchanged
- Context preserved
- Searchable history

### Dimension 3: Topics
Humans remember **what it was about**.

Project-centric folders:
- All related documents
- Decision history
- Knowledge base

## File Structure

```
workspace/
├── memory/                 # Daily work logs
├── AI-memory-backup/       # Conversation transcripts  
├── topic-memory/           # Project folders
│   ├── project-[name]/
│   ├── decision-[name]/

│   └── knowledge-[name]/
└── [your other files]
```

## Success Stories

**Before**: 5 minutes searching for files  
**After**: 10 seconds, every time

**Before**: "Did we discuss this before?"  
**After**: "Yes, on Feb 21st, here's exactly what you said"

**Before**: "Where did I put that proposal?"  
**After**: "In the product-launch folder, version 3"

## Why This Changes Everything

Traditional: **Where did I save it?**  
3D Memory: **When did we discuss it?** → **What was it about?** → Found.

Your brain doesn't organize files by type (PDF, DOC, PNG).  
Your brain organizes by **time**, **conversation**, and **topic**.

This skill does the same.
