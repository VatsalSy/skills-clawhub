```markdown
User: "We need to decide on pricing strategy today"

AI: "What are you considering?"

User: "Three options: single tier at $99, or three tiers"

AI: "Three tiers allows you to capture different segments. 
      What price points are you thinking?"

User: "$29, $99, $299"

AI: "Consider the psychology. $29 signals 'budget tool', 
      $299 signals 'enterprise solution'. 
      What's your target customer?"

## How This Helps

### Scenario 1: "What did we decide about pricing?"

**Traditional search**:  
Look through Documents/Projects/2026/Q1/Pricing/  
Time: 3-5 minutes

**Three-dimensional memory**:
1. Check `memory/2026-02-17.md` → "Discussed Q1 product roadmap"
2. Check `topic-memory/project-product-launch/pricing-strategy.md`  
   → Complete pricing history with rationale
3. Check `AI-memory-backup/backup-20260217.md`  
   → "What price points are you thinking? $29, $99, $299"

**Time: 30 seconds**

### Scenario 2: "Why did we choose March 15?"

**Traditional search**:  
Search email, documents, meeting notes...  
Time: 5+ minutes

**Three-dimensional memory**:
1. Check `topic-memory/project-product-launch/timeline.md`  
   → Launch: Mar 15
2. Check `memory/2026-02-19.md`  
   → "CEO approved final pricing... Launch announcement scheduled for Feb 25"
3. Check `topic-memory/project-product-launch/key-decisions.md`  
   → "Rationale: Allows 3 weeks for final preparations"

**Time: 20 seconds**

### Scenario 3: "What exactly did I say about the $29 tier?"

**Traditional search**:  
Nearly impossible to find exact quote

**Three-dimensional memory**:
1. Check `AI-memory-backup/backup-20260217.md`  
   → Full conversation transcript
2. Search for "$29"  
   → "User: $29, $99, $299"  
   → "AI: Consider the psychology. $29 signals 'budget tool'"

**Time: 15 seconds**
