# Scaling Strategy

## Overview
Scaling means growing revenue without proportionally growing your time investment. For solopreneurs, scaling is about leverage: automation, delegation, and systems. This playbook shows you when to scale, how to scale, and how to avoid the traps that kill growth. Not every business should scale — but if yours should, here's how.

---

## Step 1: Decide If You Should Scale

Scaling isn't always the right move. It adds complexity, stress, and overhead. Be honest about your goals.

**Reasons TO scale:**
- You've maxed out your capacity (turning down work or burning out)
- Revenue has plateaued and you can't grow solo
- You want to build a business that runs without you (exit potential)
- You have repeatable systems and proven product-market fit
- You want to create jobs and build a team

**Reasons NOT to scale:**
- You're happy with current income and lifestyle
- Your business model doesn't scale (high-touch consulting, creative services that require YOUR specific expertise)
- You haven't validated product-market fit yet (fix this first)
- You value freedom and simplicity over growth

**Questions to ask before scaling:**
- Is my business profitable as a solo operation? (If no, scaling won't fix it — scaling amplifies what exists.)
- Do I have systems and processes that someone else could follow? (If no, document first.)
- Am I willing to give up some control? (Scaling means delegating — if you're a perfectionist, this will be painful.)
- Do I have 6+ months of runway to invest in growth? (Scaling costs money upfront before it pays off.)

**Rule:** Only scale if you've hit a ceiling as a solo operator AND you want to grow beyond it. Otherwise, optimize for lifestyle, not growth.

## Step 2: Identify Your Bottlenecks

You can't scale everything at once. Find the constraint that's limiting growth.

**Common solopreneur bottlenecks:**

| Bottleneck | Symptom | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **Your time** | Turning down work, working 60+ hrs/week | Delegate or automate tasks |
| **Lead generation** | Not enough prospects in pipeline | Invest in marketing, outreach, or sales |
| **Conversion rate** | Lots of leads, few close | Improve sales process, pricing, or positioning |
| **Delivery capacity** | Can't deliver fast enough | Hire contractors, automate workflows |
| **Cash flow** | Profitable but can't afford to hire | Adjust payment terms, raise prices, or get financing |

**How to find your bottleneck:**
1. Map your entire business process (marketing → sales → delivery → support)
2. Identify which stage is slowest or maxed out
3. Fix that stage first before moving to the next

**Theory of Constraints:** Improving non-bottleneck stages doesn't increase throughput. Only fixing the bottleneck does.

## Step 3: Scale Through Automation First

Before hiring, automate. Automation is cheaper and more reliable than people.

**What to automate (see automation-workflows skill for details):**
- Marketing: Email sequences, social media scheduling, lead nurturing
- Sales: CRM updates, proposal generation, contract signing
- Delivery: Template-based work, file generation, data processing
- Support: FAQs, chatbots, help center, ticket routing
- Operations: Invoicing, expense tracking, reporting

**Automation ROI threshold:**
- If a task takes 15+ minutes and you do it 10+ times/month → automate it
- If automation setup takes 4 hours and saves 2 hours/month → pays back in 2 months → do it

**Rule:** Automate the repetitive. Delegate the judgment-based.

## Step 4: Delegate by Hiring Contractors (Start Here)

Contractors are the lowest-risk way to scale. No payroll taxes, no benefits, no long-term commitment.

**Best tasks to delegate first:**

| Task Type | Who to Hire | Where to Find Them | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Admin / VA** | Virtual assistant | Upwork, Belay, Time Etc | $15-40/hr |
| **Content creation** | Writer, designer, video editor | Upwork, Fiverr, 99designs | $25-100/hr |
| **Development / Tech** | Developer, no-code specialist | Upwork, Toptal, gun.io | $50-150/hr |
| **Marketing / Ads** | Marketing specialist, ads manager | Upwork, Mayple | $50-100/hr |
| **Customer support** | Support specialist | Upwork, SupportNinja | $15-30/hr |
| **Bookkeeping** | Bookkeeper or CPA | Bench, Pilot, local CPA | $200-500/mo |

**How to delegate effectively:**

### Step 1: Document the process
Before delegating, write down HOW to do the task (see Step 5 on SOPs). If you can't explain it clearly, you can't delegate it.

### Step 2: Start small
Give them 5-10 hours of work first (a trial project). Evaluate quality before committing to more.

### Step 3: Provide feedback early
If the work isn't right, say so immediately (kindly but clearly). Don't let bad work pile up.

### Step 4: Use tools for collaboration
- Project management: Asana, Trello, Notion
- Communication: Slack, email
- File sharing: Google Drive, Dropbox
- Time tracking (if hourly): Toggl, Harvest

### Step 5: Trust but verify
Give them autonomy, but check the work initially. As they prove themselves, check less frequently.

**Rule:** Hire for tasks you hate or tasks someone else can do 80% as well as you for 20% of the cost.

## Step 5: Create Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

SOPs are step-by-step instructions for recurring tasks. Without them, you can't delegate effectively.

**SOP template:**
```
TASK: [Name of the task]
OWNER: [Who's responsible]
FREQUENCY: [How often this happens]
TOOLS NEEDED: [Software, logins, files]

STEPS:
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
   [include screenshots or videos if helpful]
...

COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:
- Issue: [Problem that might occur]
  Solution: [How to fix it]

CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Step 1 complete
- [ ] Step 2 complete
- [ ] Final review complete
```

**Start with these SOPs:**
- Client onboarding process
- How to respond to common support questions
- How to publish a blog post (or whatever content you create)
- How to generate and send invoices
- How to create [deliverable] for clients

**Where to store SOPs:**
- Notion, Google Docs, or Confluence
- Make them easily searchable by task name
- Update them when processes change

**Rule:** If you do something more than twice, document it. Future you (or your contractors) will thank you.

## Step 6: Consider Hiring Employees (Advanced)

Employees are a bigger commitment than contractors. Only hire employees when:
- You need 30+ hours/week of work consistently
- The role requires deep integration with your business (not project-based)
- You can afford salary + benefits + payroll taxes (adds ~30% to base salary cost)

**Employee vs. Contractor decision:**

| Factor | Hire Contractor | Hire Employee |
|---|---|---|
| Hours needed | < 30/week | 30+ hours/week |
| Duration | Project-based or variable | Ongoing, indefinite |
| Control | Minimal (they set schedule/method) | High (you control when/how they work) |
| Cost | Hourly rate only | Salary + benefits + taxes |
| Risk | Low (easy to stop working together) | High (harder to terminate, legal risks) |

**First employee to hire (if you hire one):** Operations manager or executive assistant. Someone who can take all the admin, scheduling, and coordination off your plate so you can focus on revenue-generating work.

**Rule:** Stay contractor-based as long as possible. Employees add complexity. Only hire when contractors can't meet the need.

---

## Step 7: Scale Revenue Before Scaling Team

Many solopreneurs hire too early, before revenue justifies it. The result: cash flow crisis.

**Revenue scaling strategies:**

### 1. Raise prices
Easiest way to scale revenue without adding work. Raise prices 20-30% on new customers. Existing customers can be grandfathered or moved to new pricing over time.

### 2. Add recurring revenue
One-time projects don't scale. Retainers, subscriptions, or recurring services do. Shift your model toward recurring income.

### 3. Productize your service
Turn your custom service into a repeatable package with fixed scope and price. Allows you to deliver faster and more consistently.

### 4. Create self-serve offerings
Add a lower-priced tier that doesn't require your time (courses, templates, SaaS, digital products). This adds revenue without adding delivery load.

### 5. Increase average deal size
Upsell existing customers on premium features, add-ons, or expanded scope. Easier than finding new customers.

**Rule:** Double revenue before doubling team size. Revenue growth should always lead, not lag, team growth.

## Step 8: Build Systems for Sustainable Growth

Scaling without systems leads to chaos. Systems allow growth without breaking.

**Core systems to build:**

1. **Sales system** (see sales-funnel-design, outreach-and-prospecting)
   - Lead capture → qualification → proposal → close
   - CRM to track every lead
   - Repeatable sales process

2. **Delivery system**
   - Templates for recurring deliverables
   - Project management workflow (see project-management)
   - Quality control checkpoints

3. **Support system** (see support-systems)
   - Help center with FAQs
   - Ticket system with SLA targets
   - Escalation process

4. **Financial system** (see bookkeeping-basics, financial-planning)
   - Monthly P&L review
   - Cash flow tracking
   - Budget for team/tool expenses

5. **Marketing system** (see content-strategy, email-marketing, social-media-marketing)
   - Content calendar
   - Lead generation engine
   - Conversion funnel

**Rule:** Build the system before you need it. Systems feel like overkill when you're small — but they're essential when you scale.

## Step 9: Avoid the Scaling Traps

Scaling brings new problems. Here's how to avoid the most common ones:

**Trap 1: Scaling too fast**
→ Cash runs out, quality drops, you lose control
**Solution:** Grow 20-30% per quarter, not 100% overnight

**Trap 2: Hiring the wrong people**
→ Bad hires cost time, money, and momentum
**Solution:** Start with trial projects. Hire slowly, fire quickly.

**Trap 3: Losing focus**
→ Trying to do too much at once
**Solution:** Focus on ONE bottleneck at a time

**Trap 4: Not documenting processes**
→ Everything depends on you, nothing scales
**Solution:** Write SOPs for every recurring task

**Trap 5: Neglecting culture as you grow**
→ Team becomes dysfunctional, communication breaks down
**Solution:** Define values early. Hire for culture fit, not just skills.

## Scaling Mistakes to Avoid
- **Scaling before profitability.** If you're not profitable solo, you won't be profitable with a team. Fix the model first.
- **Hiring too early.** Revenue should always lead team growth. Hire when you can't keep up, not when you're bored or lonely.
- **Not documenting processes before delegating.** If it's not documented, you'll waste hours re-explaining it every time.
- **Trying to scale everything at once.** Scale one bottleneck at a time. Focus is everything.
- **Forgetting why you started.** Many solopreneurs scale into a job they hate. Be intentional about what kind of business you're building.
