# Weather Analysis Guide

Detailed guidance for analyzing and interpreting weather data for both humans and pets.

## Pet-Friendly Weather Analysis

### Temperature Safety for Pets

**Heat Stress Risk:**
- **Above 35°C**: Extremely dangerous - NO outdoor activities for pets
- **30-35°C**: High risk - limit to 10-15 minute walks, early morning only
- **25-30°C**: Moderate risk - provide shade, water, limit vigorous exercise
- **20-25°C**: Comfortable for most pets - normal activity OK
- **10-20°C**: Ideal range - perfect for extended outdoor time
- **0-10°C**: Cool - short-haired/senior pets may need jackets
- **Below 0°C**: Cold risk - limit outdoor time, protective clothing needed

### Breed-Specific Considerations

**Heat-Sensitive Breeds:**
- Brachycephalic (flat-faced): Bulldogs, Pugs, Boxers - reduced heat tolerance
- Thick-coated: Huskies, Malamutes, Saint Bernards - prone to overheating
- Large breeds: Great Danes, Mastiffs - struggle in heat

**Cold-Sensitive Breeds:**
- Short-haired: Greyhounds, Whippets, Chihuahuas - need winter coats
- Small breeds: Less body mass = faster heat loss
- Senior/young pets: Poor temperature regulation

### Ground Safety

**Hot Pavement Test:**
- Use back of hand on pavement for 7 seconds
- If too hot for you, too hot for paws
- Pavement can be 20°C hotter than air temperature

**Cold Ground Hazards:**
- Ice: Slip hazard, can cause injuries
- Salt/de-icers: Toxic if licked, irritates paws
- Snow: Can ball up between toes

**Protection Measures:**
- Paw balm/wax before walks
- Dog booties for extreme conditions
- Rinse paws after winter walks

### UV Protection for Pets

**High-Risk Pets:**
- White/light-colored fur
- Thin or no fur (hairless breeds)
- Pink skin/noses
- Exposed skin areas (ears, nose, belly)

**Protection Methods:**
- Pet-safe sunscreen (zinc oxide-free)
- UV-protective clothing
- Avoid peak UV hours (10 AM - 4 PM)

## Temperature Analysis

### Comfort Levels (Celsius)

- **Below 0°C**: Very cold - heavy winter clothing required
- **0-10°C**: Cold - layers and warm clothing needed
- **10-15°C**: Cool - light jacket or sweater
- **15-20°C**: Mild - comfortable with light clothing
- **20-25°C**: Warm - ideal for most outdoor activities
- **25-30°C**: Hot - light, breathable clothing, stay hydrated
- **Above 30°C**: Very hot - heat precautions needed

### Temperature Trends

- **Rising (>3°C increase)**: Weather improving, layers can be shed
- **Falling (>3°C decrease)**: Cold front approaching, prepare for cooler weather
- **Stable (<3°C change)**: Consistent conditions, predictable planning

### Diurnal Range

- **Small range (<5°C)**: Overcast or maritime climate, steady temperatures
- **Large range (>10°C)**: Clear skies, continental climate, significant day-night difference

## Precipitation Analysis

### Probability Thresholds

- **0-20%**: Very unlikely, minimal concern
- **20-40%**: Low probability, monitor but don't worry
- **40-60%**: Moderate chance, have backup plans
- **60-80%**: Likely, plan indoor alternatives
- **80-100%**: Very likely to certain, prepare accordingly

### Precipitation Types

- **Rain**: Standard precipitation, manageable with umbrella
- **Drizzle**: Light but persistent, can dampen outdoor plans
- **Showers**: Intermittent, may have dry windows
- **Thunderstorm**: Heavy rain, lightning risk, avoid outdoor activities
- **Snow**: Cold weather precipitation, travel impacts possible
- **Freezing Rain**: Hazardous, travel dangerous

### Timing Analysis

- **Morning rain**: May clear for afternoon activities
- **Afternoon showers**: Plan indoor or covered activities 2-6 PM
- **Evening/night rain**: Less impact on daytime plans
- **All-day precipitation**: Indoor activities recommended

## Wind Analysis

### Beaufort Scale (Simplified)

- **0-5 km/h**: Calm to light air - ideal conditions
- **5-15 km/h**: Light breeze - pleasant, good for activities
- **15-30 km/h**: Gentle to moderate breeze - noticeable, may affect some activities
- **30-50 km/h**: Fresh to strong breeze - challenging for some outdoor activities
- **50-75 km/h**: Near gale to gale - difficult conditions, caution advised
- **>75 km/h**: Storm force - dangerous, avoid outdoor activities

### Wind Direction Impact

- **Onshore (sea to land)**: May bring moisture, cooler in summer
- **Offshore (land to sea)**: Often drier, can be warmer
- **From polar regions**: Cold air mass
- **From tropical regions**: Warm air mass

## Humidity Analysis

### Comfort Levels

- **30-50%**: Comfortable - ideal conditions
- **50-60%**: Acceptable - slightly humid
- **60-70%**: Humid - may feel muggy
- **70-80%**: Very humid - uncomfortable, potential for precipitation
- **>80%**: Extremely humid - oppressive, high dew point

### High Humidity Impact

- Feels warmer than actual temperature (heat index)
- Increases perceived exertion during exercise
- Reduces cooling efficiency of sweating
- Can cause mold/mildew issues

### Low Humidity Impact

- Feels cooler than actual temperature
- Static electricity common
- Skin and respiratory dryness
- Increased fire risk in some conditions

## UV Index Analysis

### UV Levels

- **0-2 (Low)**: Minimal protection needed, safe for outdoor activities
- **3-5 (Moderate)**: Sun protection recommended during midday
- **6-7 (High)**: Sun protection essential, limit midday sun exposure
- **8-10 (Very High)**: Extra protection needed, avoid midday sun
- **11+ (Extreme)**: Avoid sun exposure, seek shade during daylight

### Protection Measures

- **Low**: Minimal concern
- **Moderate**: Sunscreen SPF 15+, hat during midday
- **High**: SPF 30+, hat, sunglasses, seek shade 10 AM - 4 PM
- **Very High**: SPF 50+, protective clothing, stay indoors during peak hours
- **Extreme**: Avoid outdoor exposure if possible

## Visibility Analysis

### Visibility Ranges

- **>10 km**: Excellent - clear conditions
- **5-10 km**: Good - normal conditions
- **2-5 km**: Moderate - some haze or light precipitation
- **1-2 km**: Poor - fog, heavy precipitation, or pollution
- **<1 km**: Very poor - dangerous travel conditions, dense fog

### Travel Impact

- **Poor visibility (<2 km)**: Slow down, use headlights, allow extra travel time
- **Very poor visibility (<1 km)**: Consider postponing travel, use fog lights

## Air Quality Considerations

While not always included in basic weather data, consider:

- **AQI (Air Quality Index)**: If available, note for sensitive groups
- **Pollen counts**: Important for allergy sufferers
- **Pollution levels**: Urban areas may have poor air quality

## Weather Pattern Recognition

### Improving Weather Signs

- Rising pressure
- Decreasing humidity
- Clearing skies
- Wind shifting to favorable direction
- Temperature trending toward seasonal norm

### Deteriorating Weather Signs

- Falling pressure
- Increasing humidity
- Cloud cover increasing
- Wind direction changing to unfavorable
- Temperature extremes (too high or too low)

## Activity-Specific Recommendations

### Outdoor Sports

- **Running**: Ideal 15-20°C, low humidity, light wind
- **Cycling**: Check wind speed and direction, visibility
- **Swimming**: UV index important, avoid thunderstorms
- **Hiking**: Temperature range, precipitation, visibility critical

### Events & Gatherings

- **Outdoor events**: Check all factors 24-48 hours ahead
- **Weddings/Parties**: Have indoor backup for precipitation >40%
- **BBQs**: Wind speed important for cooking, avoid rain

### Travel

- **Road travel**: Visibility, precipitation, wind
- **Air travel**: Check departure and arrival airports
- **Sea travel**: Wind speed, wave height if available

## Reporting Format
