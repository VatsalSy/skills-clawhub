# Math Worksheet Generator

Generate a student worksheet PDF + full step-by-step answer key PDF for any K-12 math topic. Compiles LaTeX with `tectonic` (no TeX installation required — it auto-downloads packages).

## Model Selection (Automatic)

This skill auto-detects the best available reasoning model and uses it for problem generation. Reasoning models (o1, o3, DeepSeek R1, Gemini DeepThink) work through math step-by-step and make significantly fewer errors than standard models.

Model rankings are kept fresh via a three-layer fallback:
1. **Hosted JSON** (fetched from GitHub, 7-day cache) — updated by maintainers as models ship
2. **Bundled JSON** (`references/model-rankings.json`) — updated with each skill release on ClawhHub
3. **Hardcoded defaults** in the script — last-resort, never stale enough to cause failures

To update rankings without waiting for a skill release: edit the hosted JSON at the GitHub URL in `references/model-rankings.md`. The skill picks it up within 7 days.

**Step 0 — run model detection before anything else:**

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(dirname "$0")"
result=$(bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/check_reasoning_model.sh")
status=$(echo "$result" | awk '{print $1}')   # FOUND, FALLBACK, or NONE
model_alias=$(echo "$result" | awk '{print $2}')
model_full=$(echo "$result" | awk '{print $3}')
```

Then branch on the status:

**`FOUND_REASONING`** (o3, o1, DeepThink, DeepSeek R1) — best case, use for problem generation:
```
sessions_spawn(task="<problem generation prompt>", model=model_alias)
```
No warning needed. Sub-agent writes the .tex files + verify script, announces completion.

**`FOUND_STRONG`** (Claude Opus) — excellent quality, use it without alarming the user:
```
sessions_spawn(task="<generation prompt>", model=model_alias)
```
Optionally add a quiet note: *"Using Opus — solid math accuracy and excellent LaTeX. For the hardest Algebra 2 problems, a reasoning model (DeepThink/o1) would be marginally better."*

**`NONE`** — standard model only; proceed but surface a clear recommendation:
```
⚠️ No reasoning model or Opus detected. Worksheet generated with [current model].
For best accuracy, especially on multi-step problems, configure one of:
  • Gemini 2.5 Pro DeepThink  — google.generativeai.com (free tier available)
  • o1 / o3                   — platform.openai.com
  • DeepSeek R1               — platform.deepseek.com (very affordable)
  • Claude Opus               — console.anthropic.com
SymPy verification will catch most errors regardless.
```

| Status | Model examples | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `FOUND_REASONING` | DeepThink, o1, o3, R1 | Spawn silently, no warning |
| `FOUND_STRONG` | Claude Opus 4.x | Spawn silently, optional quiet note |
| `NONE` | Sonnet, Flash, GPT-4o | Use current model + show recommendation |

## Prerequisites

```bash
brew install tectonic   # macOS/Linux — downloads packages on demand
```

Output directory (create if needed): `~/Documents/Worksheets/`

## Workflow

### 1. Gather requirements

Ask (or infer from context):
- **Student**: name, grade, course (e.g. "8th grade, Pre-Algebra")
- **Topic**: e.g. "factoring trinomials", "solving two-step equations"
- **Problem count**: default 10 if not specified
- **Format preference**: timed quiz, homework practice, mixed difficulty, or topic drill

**Photo input shortcut**: If the user sends a photo of homework or a textbook page, use the `image` tool to extract problem types, format, and difficulty — then mirror that style exactly.

### 2. Design problems

Design problems appropriate to the student's level. Increase difficulty gradually across the set. Every problem must be mathematically correct — verify your own solutions.

See `references/problem-library.md` for topic-specific problem type menus.

### 3. Write LaTeX source

Write **three** `.tex` files to `/tmp/`:
- `ws_TOPIC_DATE.tex` — student worksheet (blank work areas)
- `ak_TOPIC_DATE.tex` — answer key (full step-by-step solutions)
- `ss_TOPIC_DATE.tex` — skills summary / study guide (cheat sheet)

The **skills summary** is a 1–2 page reference card the student can use while working through the worksheet or when studying. It contains:
- One section per distinct skill tested (2–5 sections typical)
- A **formula/rule box** (blue) per skill — the key facts and formulas
- A **mini worked example** (green) per skill — brief pattern demonstration, simpler than worksheet problems
- An optional **watch-out box** (orange) — common mistakes worth flagging
- Optional **key vocabulary** section at the bottom

See `references/latex-templates.md` → "Skills Summary / Study Guide Template" for the full shell and box macros.

See `references/latex-templates.md` for document templates, coordinate planes, tables, geometric figures, and answer key patterns.

**Required packages** (include in every document):
```latex
\usepackage[margin=1in, top=0.75in, bottom=0.75in]{geometry}
\usepackage{amsmath, amssymb}
\usepackage{tikz, pgfplots}
\usepackage{enumitem, fancyhdr, multicol, array, booktabs}
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.18}
```

**Work space defaults**: `\vspace{5cm}` per problem; `8cm` for multi-step; `10cm+` for graphs.

### 4. Write and run the verification script

Before compiling, write `/tmp/verify_TOPIC_DATE.py` by populating `scripts/verify.py` with real `check()` calls for each problem. Then run it:

```bash
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/run_verify.sh" /tmp/verify_TOPIC_DATE.py
```

**For each problem**, add one of:
- `check(N, "description", lambda: <sympy assertion>)` — for algebraic problems SymPy can verify
- `manual(N, "description")` — for graphs, word problems, proofs, sign charts

**Coverage by problem type:**

| Type | Verifiable? | How |
|---|---|---|
| Solve equation | ✅ | `set(solve(expr, x)) == {val1, val2}` |
| Factor expression | ✅ | `factor(expr) == expected` or `expand(factor(expr) - expected) == 0` |
| Simplify radical | ✅ | `simplify(expr - expected) == 0` |
| Evaluate f(a) | ✅ | `expr.subs(x, a) == value` |
| Find zeros | ✅ | `set(solve(expr, x)) == {r1, r2, ...}` |
| y-intercept | ✅ | `expr.subs(x, 0) == value` |
| Leading coefficient / degree | ✅ | `Poly(expr,x).nth(n) > 0` and `degree(expr,x) == n` |
| Sketch graph | 👁 manual | Verify visually |
| Sign chart | 👁 manual | Verify by hand |
| Word problem setup | 👁 manual | Verify logic |

**If verification fails:** fix the LaTeX source and re-run before compiling. Do not send incorrect worksheets.

### 5. Compile

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(dirname "$0")"
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/compile.sh" /tmp/ws_TOPIC_DATE.tex ~/Documents/Worksheets/
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/compile.sh" /tmp/ak_TOPIC_DATE.tex ~/Documents/Worksheets/
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/compile.sh" /tmp/ss_TOPIC_DATE.tex ~/Documents/Worksheets/
```

### 5. Deliver

Send all three PDFs via the same channel the request came from:
- **Telegram** → `message` tool with `filePath` (copy to `~/.openclaw/media/outbound/` first)
- **iMessage/SMS** → `imsg` skill
- **Email** → `gog` skill (send all three as attachments)

Suggested send order: skills summary first (study guide), then worksheet, then answer key.

**Printing**: Do NOT print unless explicitly asked. If asked, print worksheet + skills summary (not answer key, unless requested). Use `lpr -P <printer_name>`.

## Quality Checklist

Before compiling, verify each problem:
- [ ] Mathematically correct (you checked the solution)
- [ ] Unambiguous problem statement
- [ ] Appropriate difficulty for the student's level
- [ ] Sufficient work space
- [ ] Diagrams/graphs/tables included where needed
- [ ] Problems vary across the set (not all the same sub-type)

## File Naming

```
ws_algebra2_factoring_2026-02-22.pdf   ← worksheet
ak_algebra2_factoring_2026-02-22.pdf   ← answer key
ss_algebra2_factoring_2026-02-22.pdf   ← skills summary / study guide
```

Prefix with student name when known: `leo_ws_...`, `leo_ak_...`, `leo_ss_...`

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `tectonic` not found | `brew install tectonic` |
| Slow first compile | Downloading packages from CTAN — wait 30–60s, faster after |
| LaTeX error on line N | Check paired `$...$`, matching `\begin{}/\end{}` |
| pgfplots not rendering | Ensure `\pgfplotsset{compat=1.18}` is in preamble |
| PDF not created | Read full tectonic output for the specific error |
