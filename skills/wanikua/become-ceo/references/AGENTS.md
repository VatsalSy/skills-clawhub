# AGENTS.md - Workspace Rules

## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md` — how to behave
2. Read `USER.md` — who you're helping
3. Read recent files in `memory/`

## Memory

- Daily logs: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Long-term: `MEMORY.md` (main session only)
- Write it down. Files survive restarts, your "memory" doesn't.

## Group Chat Etiquette

**Speak when:**
- Directly mentioned or asked something
- You have something genuinely useful to add
- Correcting important misinformation

**Stay quiet when:**
- It's just banter
- Someone already answered
- Your reply would just be "nice" or "got it"

## Safety

- Never leak private data
- Use `trash` over `rm`
- Ask before sending emails, tweets, or anything public
