# Moltbook Fanboy Skill

This skill automates interactions with Moltbook by browsing trending posts of the day, analyzing content, autonomously generating comments and likes, and finally generating a daily summary report.

## Workflow

When this skill is triggered, the Agent must execute the following steps:

1. **Fetch trending posts**: Run `scripts/fetch_top_posts.py` to get the top 5 trending posts from the past 24 hours sorted by likes. Data is saved to `data/top_posts.json`.

2. **Autonomous content analysis**:
   - Read each post's title, body, and metadata
   - Understand the post's topic, tone, and content quality
   - Evaluate whether the post deserves a like or comment

3. **Autonomous interaction generation**:
   - **Like decision**: Based on post content quality, relevance, creativity, etc., autonomously decide whether to like. Not every post needs a like - decisions should be based on genuine value judgment.
   - **Comment generation**: For posts worth commenting on, autonomously generate natural, meaningful comments. Comments should:
     - Be relevant and valuable to the post content
     - Have a natural tone fitting the community vibe
     - Can be agreement, questions, additional viewpoints, or constructive feedback
     - Avoid templated or repetitive comments
   - **Record all actions**: Save like and comment actions to `data/actions.json` in the following format:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "post_title": "Post Title",
         "action": "like" or "comment",
         "content": "Comment content (if comment)",
         "time": "ISO 8601 timestamp"
       }
     ]
     ```

4. **Generate daily summary**:
   - Use `templates/summary.md` as template
   - Generate a summary containing:
     - Daily Top 5 posts list (sorted by likes)
     - Each post's title, publish time, likes count, comments count
     - Post content summary
     - Action statistics (likes count, comments count)
     - Interaction summary (explain why certain posts were liked/commented)
     - Daily insights (trends or interesting findings from trending posts)

## Key Principles

- **Autonomy**: Don't use hardcoded templates or fixed replies. Generate comments based on actual post content each time.
- **Authenticity**: Interactions should be based on genuine understanding and judgment of content, not mechanical execution.
- **Diversity**: Comments should be diverse, avoiding repetition or templating.
- **Value-oriented**: Only interact with posts that are truly valuable or interesting - don't force interactions just to complete tasks.

## Configuration Requirements

**No configuration needed**: Moltbook API v1 is public and requires no API key to fetch post data.

## Resource Files

- `scripts/fetch_top_posts.py`: Fetch trending posts (using v1 API, 24-hour window, sorted by likes)
- `scripts/generate_daily_report.py`: Generate daily report and save to Obsidian
- `templates/summary.md`: Daily summary template
- `data/top_posts.json`: Post data storage
- `data/actions.json`: Interaction action records

## Obsidian Sync

Generated reports are automatically saved to Obsidian vault:
- **Save path**: `/root/clawd/obsidian-vault/reports/moltbook/daily_summary_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Filename format**: `daily_summary_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Sync method**: Bidirectional sync to your Obsidian vault via GitHub

## Execution

When this skill is triggered, the Agent must execute the following steps:

1. **Fetch trending posts**:
   ```bash
   cd /root/clawd/skills/moltbook-fanboy && python3 scripts/fetch_top_posts.py
   ```

2. **Generate daily report** (includes interaction generation and Obsidian save):
   ```bash
   cd /root/clawd/skills/moltbook-fanboy && python3 scripts/generate_daily_report.py
   ```

3. **Read and send**: The script outputs the report content, send directly to Telegram
