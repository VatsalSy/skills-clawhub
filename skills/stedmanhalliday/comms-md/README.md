# COMMS.md Creator

Create a structured communication preferences document through guided conversation.

A COMMS.md captures how someone communicates: style, channel preferences, availability rhythms, async voice, and interaction protocols. Designed to be read by both humans and agents before initiating contact.

## What it does

- Guides an interactive interview covering style, collaboration model, weekly rhythm, sync philosophy, channel preferences, async voice, and boundaries
- Generates a structured, queryable document using the person's own words
- Includes a template and example for reference

## When to use it

- Someone wants to articulate how they communicate
- Someone wants a document other people's agents can read before reaching out
- Someone says "COMMS.md" or asks about communication preferences
