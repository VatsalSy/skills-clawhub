# KB Segmentation Suggestion for Yuboto API Content

Use language + business-unit segmentation:

- `kb_gr_messaging`
- `kb_en_messaging`
- `kb_gr_telephony` (if telephony API docs are separate)
- `kb_en_ai_agents` (for voicelogica.ai / AI-agent docs)

For Omni API specifically, start with:
- `kb_gr_messaging_api`
- `kb_en_messaging_api`

Keep swagger JSON as canonical source for endpoints and params.
Use PDF as supplemental narrative/process guide.
