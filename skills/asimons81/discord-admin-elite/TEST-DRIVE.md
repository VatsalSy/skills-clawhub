# Discord Admin Elite — Test Drive

Use these prompts to test the skill quality.

## Test Prompt 1 (New server)
"Design me an elite Discord server from scratch for AI builders. I want role structure, channel architecture, anti-raid setup, onboarding flow, and a 30-day engagement plan."

## Test Prompt 2 (Audit existing server)
"Audit my current Discord server setup and give me a score out of 100, top risks, and a prioritized fix plan for 24h/7d/30d."

## Test Prompt 3 (Hard mode)
"We have 5k members, raids twice a month, low first-message conversion, and dead event channels. Give me a surgical recovery plan with what to change first and what to measure."

- A scored audit framework (not generic advice)
- Clear role/permission hardening recommendations
