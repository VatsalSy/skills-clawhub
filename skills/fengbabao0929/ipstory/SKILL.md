# Personal Brand Story Generator

Generate compelling personal brand stories using the proven 5-step framework.

## The 5-Step Story Structure

Every effective personal brand story follows this structure:

| Step | Purpose | Key Elements |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **1. Pain/Event Resonance** | Connect with reader through shared experience | Describe a relatable struggle, Paint a vivid picture, Use sensory details |
| **2. Key Turning Point** | The "Why Change?" moment | What triggered the change, Use contrast (before/after), Use parallel sentences, Strong philosophy + belief output |
| **3. Conflict Depiction** | Show the struggle during change | External obstacles (doubt, opposition, failure), Internal emotional struggle, Strong philosophy reinforcement |
| **4. Strong Philosophy Output** | Elevate to universal truth | Counter-intuitive insights, Parallel sentences for impact, Memorable quotes/golden lines |
| **5. Highlight Results** | Prove with data and social proof | Effort invested, Data/results/case studies, Before/after comparison, User testimonials |

## Writing Principles

### Tone & Style
- **Authentic vulnerability**: Share real struggles, not curated perfection
- **Specific over generic**: Use concrete numbers, dates, names
- **Emotional resonance**: Connect to universal human experiences (family, fear, loss, ambition)
- **Professional credibility**: Balance personal story with expertise proof

### Data Requirements
For each story, gather:
- **Origin story**: Where you started (specific salary, position, situation)
- **Turning point**: Exact moment or event that triggered change
- **Obstacles**: Specific challenges faced (internal and external)
- **Proof points**: Hard numbers, timelines, recognizable names
- **Philosophy**: Core beliefs that guide your work

### Common Patterns

**Pattern A: Corporate Escape**
- Starts: Stable job, unfulfilled
- Turning Point: Health scare, family event, burnout realization
- Conflict: Leaving security, others' doubts, early failures
- Result: Built successful business on own terms

**Pattern B: Expert to Entrepreneur**
- Starts: High achiever in corporate/field
- Turning Point: Realized income ceiling, wanted impact + freedom
- Conflict: Imposter syndrome, pricing fears, scaling challenges
- Result: Multiple income streams, recognized authority

**Pattern C: Phoenix Rising**
- Starts: Hit rock bottom (loss, failure, setback)
- Turning Point: Decision to rebuild differently
- Conflict: Rebuilding from nothing, proving worth
- Result: Stronger than before, helping others avoid same fate
