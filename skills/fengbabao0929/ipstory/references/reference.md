## Title: From 2,400 to 6 Million Monthly - What Did I Do Right?

### Opening Hook
```
Hello, I'm Wanying Xiaojiejie. This content has two parts:
1. My entrepreneurship story
2. 100 money-making tips for entrepreneurs
```

### Step 1: Pain Point Resonance (The Before)

**Pattern: Financial Struggle + Relatable Context**

"Are you satisfied with small stability, thinking a peaceful life is the best?

Every day you have a job, monthly salary, weekend gatherings with friends - life is pleasant, right?

That was me once. Born in a teacher's family, parents started from scratch, both became the youngest principals in the area.

Like many, I never felt what 'lack of money' felt like growing up."

**First Money Awareness - Specific Details:**
- Monthly salary: 2,400
- Total with overtime: ~4,000
- 60% spent on learning/certifications
- Wall Street English loan: 2,500/month
- Remaining money: only enough for one bedroom rent and cafeteria food
- "No money for clothes like other girls"

**Second Money Awareness - Study Abroad:**
- Peking University graduate, exchange to Italy's Bocconi University
- Salary cut in half for remote work arrangement
- Spent all savings on travel and study in Europe
- "I wish my salary were higher"

### Step 2: Key Turning Point (The Awakening)

**Pattern: Emotional Shock + Life Event**

"Third time was my true money consciousness awakening.

Winter 2017, I returned home for dad's birthday, unexpectedly learned my second aunt - like a mother to me - was diagnosed with late-stage cancer. A thunderbolt struck our entire family."

**Build Emotional Connection:**
- Aunt had no children, treated her like her own daughter
- Childhood spent with aunt beside parents
- "She taught me children's songs, made red bean soup, took me to pick flowers"
- "Before high school exams, she handled all my meals"
- "When I was heartbroken, she traveled to Beijing to cook warm meals for me"

**The Realization:**
"When she underwent major surgeries and was hospitalized again, I suddenly realized - accidents come without warning. I discovered something more expensive than studying abroad: cancer treatment costs. I finally awakened - I need to earn serious money."

### Step 3: Conflict Depiction (Internal & External Struggle)

**Pattern: Identity Crisis + Social Judgment**

"Many people didn't understand - a Peking University graduate doing weishang (WeChat business)?"

**External Doubts:**
- "How can a Peking University girl do weishang?"
- "Won't people block you?"
- "It's so low class"

**Internal Philosophy Response:**
"I've never cared much how others see me. Others' thoughts are beyond your control. Why focus on things you can't control instead of improving yourself? What you learn, no one can take. What you earn, no one can take."

**The Counter-Argument:**
"Selling is everywhere - in relationships, work, finding partners, even between nations. Confucius had 3,000 disciples and traveled promoting his philosophy. What's shameful about earning through honest effort?"

### Step 4: Strong Philosophy Output (Core Beliefs)

**Key Philosophical Statements:**

1. **On Creating vs. Encountering Life:**
"I love a quote: 'Rather than encountering life, create life.'"

2. **On Teaching Others How to Treat You:**
"Psychologist McGraw said: 'How others treat you is what you teach them.' I firmly believe this. How others view your weishang depends on the attitude and stance you present."

3. **On Risk Management:**
"Earning money isn't the goal - resisting sudden life risks is."

4. **On Diversified Income:**
"In this era, relying on one salary means living carefully. Build multiple income channels for more life control."

5. **On Value Exchange:**
"Sales is essentially 'value exchange.' Every job is selling your time for wages. Smart employees invest in themselves for better value exchange."
