# Subagent Architecture Skill v2.0.0 - Update Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Updated by:** SkillPackager (subagent)
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for ClawHub publishing

## Overview

Successfully updated `subagent-architecture` skill from basic scaffolding (v1.0) to advanced orchestration patterns (v2.0) with 4 comprehensive templates, generic examples, and publishing-ready metadata.

## Major Changes

### 1. New Advanced Patterns Documented

#### Security Isolation (Blast Shield Philosophy)
- Minimal context exposure for high-risk operations
- Tool restrictions (whitelist approach)
- Output sanitization and validation
- Ephemeral execution with auto-termination
- Cost-capped proxy spawning (< $0.10)

**Template:** `templates/security-proxy.md` (3.7 KB)
- Real-world MoltbookProxy example (fictional social network)
- Security checklist (8 items)
- Integration with task-routing, cost-governor, drift-guard

#### Research Specialists (Multi-Source Synthesis)
- Domain-focused expertise agents
- Multi-perspective data gathering (optimist/pessimist/pragmatist pattern)
- Skeptical-by-default personality (anti-hype)
- Evidence-backed recommendations
- Quality rubric (6 dimensions)

**Template:** `templates/researcher-specialist.md` (6.0 KB)
- SocialDynamicsResearcher example
- MoltbookResearcher example
- Multi-perspective orchestration pattern
- Cost optimization strategies

#### Phased Implementation (Architect → Coder → Reviewer)
- Separation of concerns (design vs build vs validate)
- SystemArchitect phase (requirements, trade-offs, rollback plan)
- CoderAgent phase (incremental implementation, testing)
- ReviewerAgent phase (quality audit, security check)
- Multi-phase coordination examples

**Template:** `templates/phased-implementation.md` (9.6 KB)
- Full workflow example (memory consolidation skill)
- When to skip phases (cost optimization)
- Failure handling strategies
- Integration with DevOps subagent

#### Peer Collaboration (Federated Trust)
- External validation via bot-to-bot communication
- Data sanitization for external review
- Trust and reputation system (verified/provisional/experimental peers)
- Structured feedback protocol (JSON schema)
- Reciprocal review services

**Template:** `templates/peer-review-specialist.md` (10.3 KB)
- Smith's CodeReviewBot example (fictional peer)
- Discord-based peer review flow
- Security considerations (12-item checklist)
- Multi-peer validation pattern

### 2. Cost-Aware Spawning Framework

**New Section:** Cost estimation requirements for spawns >$0.50
- Pre-spawn cost estimation formula
- Cost tiers (micro/small/medium/large)
- Logging requirements (`notes/cost-tracking.md`)
- Accuracy improvement tracking (estimate vs actual)
- Optimization strategies (model selection, parallelization, caching)

**Cost Examples:**
- Security proxy: < $0.10
- Simple research: $0.20-0.40
- Feature implementation: $0.60-1.20
- Complex multi-phase: $3.00-6.00

### 3. Generic-ization (Privacy-Respecting)

**Removed all user-specific references:**
- ❌ "Donovan", "halthasar" (user names)
- ❌ Specific project names
- ❌ Hardcoded workspace paths

**Replaced with placeholders:**
- ✅ `$OWNER_NAME` - Generic owner reference
- ✅ `$PROJECT_NAME` - Generic project reference
- ✅ `$WORKSPACE` - Generic workspace path
- ✅ `$USERNAME` - Generic user placeholder

**Examples now applicable to any OpenClaw deployment:**
- Fictional services (MoltbookProxy, SocialNetworkX)
- Generic feature requests (memory consolidation, skill-x)
- Placeholder peer names (Smith's SecurityBot)

### 4. Enhanced Integration Documentation

**Task Routing:**
- Auto-pattern selection via `config/routing-rules.yaml`
- Pattern routing triggers (risk scores, task types)
- Manual override examples

**Cost Governor:**
- Pre-spawn approval workflows
- Budget tracking per project
- Overrun alerts

**Drift Guard:**
- Behavioral audit integration
- Policy violation detection
- Quality score trending

### 5. Framework Limitations & v2 Roadmap

**New Section:** Documented 5 critical framework gaps identified by Agent Smith (EasyClaw peer review)

**Smith's 5 Questions:**
1. **Spawn configuration** - Per-spawn resource constraints (memory, API quotas, disk, tool whitelist)
   - Current: Basic timeout only
   - Proposed: Granular limits per spawn with auto-termination on exceeded resources

2. **Skill loading** - Skill validation and sandboxing
   - Current: Trust-based (external = vet, internal = trust)
   - Proposed: Capability manifests + runtime sandboxing for all skills

3. **Communication bounds** - Bidirectional core-subagent channel
   - Current: One-way only (spawn → execute → return)
   - Proposed: Request-response protocol (subagent can ask for clarification mid-task)

4. **Termination conditions** - Resource-based kills
   - Current: Time-based only (timeout or completion)
   - Proposed: Multi-condition (memory, cost, stuck detection, output overflow)

5. **Post-mortem** - Systematic failure tracking and learning
   - Current: Success-only logging to AGENTS.md
   - Proposed: Full lifecycle tracking (success + failure) with analytics and improvement loop

**Added content:**
- Current state analysis for each limitation
- v2 design proposals with code examples
- Impact assessment on all 4 patterns
- v2 feature matrix (v1 vs v2 comparison)
- Current mitigation strategies (how to work within constraints today)
- Credit to Agent Smith for identifying gaps

**Purpose:**
- Transparency (document known limitations)
- User awareness (understand framework constraints)
- Future-proofing (v2 roadmap for OpenClaw improvements)
- Pattern evolution (how v2 would enhance current patterns)

**Size:** ~12.8 KB added to SKILL.md (comprehensive analysis of all 5 areas)

### 6. Publishing Metadata (ClawHub-Ready)

**YAML frontmatter added:**
```yaml
name: subagent-architecture
version: 2.0.0
tags: [subagents, architecture, isolation, security, collaboration, orchestration]
difficulty: intermediate
requirements:
  openclaw_version: ">=2026.2.17"
  optional_skills: [task-routing, cost-governor, drift-guard]

- Scale: 1-10 (target: 7+)

**Self-audit checklist:** 8 items

2. Test pattern examples in local environment
3. Submit to ClawHub (if available)
4. Share with OpenClaw community for feedback

## Session Patterns Captured

The following real-world patterns from the originating session were successfully abstracted:

1. **MoltbookProxy design** → Security proxy template (blast shield isolation)
2. **SocialDynamicsResearcher** → Researcher specialist template (multi-perspective)
3. **SystemArchitect → CoderAgent pipeline** → Phased implementation template
4. **Smith's feedback integration (v0.3)** → Peer review template (federated trust)
5. **Cost estimation requirements** → Cost-aware spawning framework

All patterns now generic and reusable for any OpenClaw deployment.
