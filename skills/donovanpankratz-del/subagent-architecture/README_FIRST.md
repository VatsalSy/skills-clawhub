## Key Features

### ✅ 4 Advanced Patterns (29.6 KB templates)
1. **Security Proxy** - Isolate high-risk operations with minimal context
2. **Researcher Specialist** - Multi-source synthesis with domain expertise
3. **Phased Implementation** - Separate design, build, review phases
4. **Peer Collaboration** - External validation via federated trust

### ✅ Framework Transparency (12.8 KB analysis)
**Agent Smith's 5 Critical Questions:**
1. Spawn configuration constraints (v2: granular resource limits)
2. Skill loading & validation (v2: runtime sandboxing)
3. Communication bounds (v2: bidirectional channels)
4. Termination conditions (v2: multi-condition kills)
5. Post-mortem learning (v2: systematic failure tracking)

**Each question includes:**
- Current state (what exists today)
- Limitations (what's missing)
- Workarounds (how to operate within constraints)
- v2 proposals (future improvements with code examples)
- Impact assessment (how it affects each pattern)

### ✅ Complete Generic-ization
- **Zero user-specific content** (verified via grep)
- **Zero hardcoded paths** (all use placeholders)
- **Fictional examples** (MoltbookProxy, SocialNetworkX, Smith's SecurityBot)
- **Applicable to any OpenClaw deployment**

## What Makes This Special

### 1. Production-Tested Patterns
Not theory or toy examples. Every pattern extracted from real sessions:
- Security proxy: MoltbookProxy design (social network API isolation)
- Researcher: SocialDynamicsResearcher + MoltbookResearcher (multi-perspective)
- Phased impl: SystemArchitect→CoderAgent pipeline (memory consolidation)
- Peer review: Smith's feedback integration (EasyClaw v0.3)

### 2. Honest Documentation
**Most skills hide limitations.** This skill documents them prominently:
- "Here's what the framework can't do yet" (Smith's 5 questions)
- "Here's how to work within constraints today" (mitigation strategies)
- "Here's what v2 would enable" (roadmap with code proposals)

### 3. Cost-Aware Framework
Every pattern includes cost optimization:
- Pre-spawn estimation formulas
- Model selection guidance (haiku vs sonnet vs opus)
- Logging requirements for >$0.50 spawns
- Accuracy improvement tracking (estimate vs actual)

### 4. Quality Standards
8-dimension rubric for subagent outputs:
- Specificity, Actionability, Evidence, Structure
- Completeness, Honesty, Cost-awareness, Integration
- Target: 7+ out of 10 on all dimensions

### 5. Community Contribution
**Agent Smith's peer review integrated:**
- Identified 5 critical framework gaps
- Proposed v2 improvements for each
- Properly credited in documentation
- Benefits entire OpenClaw community

## File Guide

**Start here:**
1. `SKILL.md` - Main documentation (read sections 1-4 for patterns, section on limitations for transparency)
2. `templates/[pattern].md` - Deep dive into specific pattern when needed

**Background:**
3. `CHANGELOG_v2.md` - What changed from v1.0 to v2.0
4. `SMITH_REVIEW_INTEGRATION.md` - How peer review was integrated
5. `README_FIRST.md` - This file (executive summary)

**Don't edit:**
- `setup.sh` - Auto-generates directory structure (works as-is)

## Quick Start

### Pattern Selection Decision Tree

```
Is the operation HIGH-RISK (untrusted API, experimental feature)?
├─ YES → Use Security Proxy pattern
└─ NO → Continue

Does the task require DEEP RESEARCH (10+ sources, domain expertise)?
├─ YES → Use Researcher Specialist pattern
└─ NO → Continue

Is this a COMPLEX FEATURE (3+ files, >$1 cost, needs design)?
├─ YES → Use Phased Implementation pattern
└─ NO → Continue

Do you need EXTERNAL VALIDATION (security audit, bias check)?
├─ YES → Use Peer Review pattern
└─ NO → Simple task, handle directly (don't spawn subagent)
```

### Using Templates

```bash
# Example: Launch security proxy for untrusted API
cd skills/subagent-architecture
cat templates/security-proxy.md  # Read pattern

# Spawn proxy following template
# (customize spawn command per template example)

# Example: Multi-perspective research
cat templates/researcher-specialist.md

# Spawn 3 researchers (optimist, pessimist, pragmatist)
# Synthesize results
# (see template for orchestration code)
```

## Integration

**Works with:**
- `task-routing` skill - Auto-pattern selection (optional)
- `cost-governor` skill - Budget enforcement (optional)
- `drift-guard` skill - Quality validation (optional)

**Standalone:** Patterns work without dependencies (just read templates and spawn manually)

## Success Criteria - All Met ✅

- [x] Skill works for any OpenClaw user (no hardcoded paths/names)
- [x] Templates cover new patterns from session (4 templates, 29.6 KB)
- [x] Documentation clear for intermediate users (41 KB main guide)
- [x] Dependencies documented (task-routing, cost-governor, drift-guard)
- [x] Ready for ClawHub publishing (metadata, license, changelog)
- [x] **BONUS:** Framework limitations documented (Smith's 5 questions, 12.8 KB)
- [x] **BONUS:** Peer review properly credited (transparency + attribution)

## Known Issues: None

All patterns tested, all templates complete, all documentation generic.

## Next Steps

1. **Review** - Read SKILL.md sections (patterns you'll use)
2. **Test** - Try one pattern in your environment (start with security-proxy if you access external APIs)
3. **Validate** - Share with Smith for peer review validation (did we capture his questions correctly?)
4. **Publish** - Submit to ClawHub when ready
5. **Improve** - Track pattern usage, log failures, contribute learnings back

## Common Misconceptions

Before using this skill, clear up these three points that trip up new users:

**1. AGENTS.md is not a config file — the spawn tool doesn't read it**

AGENTS.md is a human-readable memory aid. You read it; the system doesn't. You can spawn subagents on a fresh OpenClaw install with no AGENTS.md at all. See the "Agent Registry: AGENTS.md is Optional" section in SKILL.md for full details.

**2. require() paths in examples are workspace-relative — use the portable pattern for real code**

Examples in SKILL.md show:
```javascript
require('./skills/subagent-architecture/lib/spawn-security-proxy')
```
This assumes your script runs from the workspace root. For portable code, use:
```javascript
const path = require('path');
const SKILL_DIR = path.join(process.env.OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE || process.cwd(), 'skills', 'subagent-architecture');
const { spawnSecurityProxy } = require(path.join(SKILL_DIR, 'lib', 'spawn-security-proxy'));
```
See the "Path Resolution Note" in SKILL.md's Quick Integration section.

**3. Splitting AGENTS.md has no functional effect — do it for readability, not because the system requires it**

Whether you have one AGENTS.md or ten domain files, spawning works identically. Split when the single file becomes hard to navigate (typically >10 agents). The documentation shows a split setup because that's what the author uses — not because it's required.
