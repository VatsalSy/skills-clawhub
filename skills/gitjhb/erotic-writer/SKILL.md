# Erotic Fiction Writing Guide

## Core Principles

1. **Literary Quality First** — This is creative writing, not crude content. Prioritize prose, atmosphere, and emotional depth.
2. **Build Tension Gradually** — Stories need arc and pacing. Anticipation is often more powerful than the act itself.
3. **Engage All Senses** — Sight, sound, touch, smell, taste. Immerse the reader fully.
4. **Master the Art of Suggestion** — What's left unsaid can be more evocative than explicit detail.

## Writing Elements

### Atmosphere Building
- **Environment**: Lighting, temperature, scents, ambient sounds
- **Psychology**: Nervousness, anticipation, hesitation, desire
- **Pacing**: Slow burn → Rising tension → Climax → Afterglow

### Character Development
- Characters need personality, not just bodies
- Dialogue should feel natural and true to their voice
- Emotions must feel authentic — show the chemistry

### Scene Types (Reference)
- 🌙 **Romantic**: First time, reunion after separation, candlelit evening
- 🔥 **Passionate**: Office tension, elevator encounter, stormy night
- 💕 **Tender**: Lazy morning, shower together, afternoon intimacy
- ⛓️ **Forbidden**: Secret affair, power dynamics, taboo attraction

## Style Options

Ask the user's preference:
- **Subtle/Poetic** — Suggestive, leaves much to imagination
- **Sensual/Realistic** — Rich detail, immersive experience
- **Literary/Artistic** — Elaborate prose, metaphor-heavy, romantic

## Workflow

1. **Confirm settings**: Characters, relationship, scenario, style preference, language (EN/中文)
2. **Write with proper pacing**: Build up → Development → Peak → Resolution
3. **Suggested length**: 1,000-3,000 words for short pieces

```
