Turn your AI agent into a construction permitting specialist. Covers the full permit lifecycle — application, plan review, inspections, and certificate of occupancy.

## What's Inside

- **10 project types** mapped to required permits and processing times
- **Residential + commercial application checklists** (nothing gets missed)
- **Top 10 plan review rejections** with fixes (save weeks of back-and-forth)
- **15-step inspection sequence** for new construction
- **Permit fee calculator** using ICC Building Valuation Data
- **Owner-builder rules**, expiration timelines, contractor license verification links
- **Red flag triggers** — flood zones, hillsides, historic districts, WUI, coastal, seismic
- **Exemption guide** — when you don't need a permit

## Who This Is For

- General contractors managing multi-trade permit packages
- Property developers navigating entitlements and approvals
- Architects and designers preparing submittal packages
- Real estate investors evaluating renovation feasibility
- Homeowners pulling permits for ADUs, additions, remodels

## Quick Start

Drop `SKILL.md` into your agent's context. Ask things like:

- "What permits do I need for a 3,000 sq ft commercial buildout?"
- "Generate an application checklist for an ADU in California"
- "Estimate permit fees for a $500K renovation"
- "What inspections are required before I can close walls?"
- "My plans were rejected for setback violations — what are my options?"
