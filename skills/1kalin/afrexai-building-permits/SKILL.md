## Common Plan Review Rejections

| Rejection Reason | How to Fix | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Missing structural calculations | Hire PE to stamp calcs for headers, beams, connections, foundation | Very Common |
| Setback violations | Redesign or apply for variance (4-12 week delay) | Common |
| Energy code non-compliance | Update insulation, windows, HVAC specs to current code cycle | Common |
| Incomplete drawings | Add missing sections, details, dimensions, notes | Very Common |
| Fire separation deficient | Upgrade wall/floor assemblies to required fire rating | Common |
| ADA non-compliance | Revise accessible routes, grab bars, clearances, slope | Common (commercial) |
| Stormwater not addressed | Add detention/retention, pervious surfaces, drainage plan | Moderate |
| Zoning use not permitted | Apply for conditional use permit or rezone (major delay) | Occasional |
| Lot coverage exceeded | Reduce footprint or get variance | Moderate |
| Height limit exceeded | Redesign or apply for variance | Occasional |

## Inspection Sequence (Typical New Construction)

1. **Foundation/Footing** — Before pouring concrete. Rebar, forms, depth, soil bearing.
2. **Underground Plumbing** — Before backfill. Slope, materials, cleanouts.
3. **Underground Electrical** — Before backfill. Conduit, grounding.
4. **Slab** — Before pour (if slab-on-grade). Vapor barrier, insulation, embedded items.
5. **Framing** — After rough framing complete. Structure, connections, sheathing, holdowns.
6. **Rough Electrical** — Wiring, boxes, panel, circuits before drywall.
7. **Rough Plumbing** — Supply, waste, vent before drywall. Pressure test.
8. **Rough Mechanical** — Ductwork, equipment, venting before drywall.
9. **Insulation/Energy** — After rough inspections pass. R-values, air sealing, vapor barriers.
10. **Drywall Nailing** — Before taping (some jurisdictions skip this).
11. **Final Electrical** — Fixtures, devices, panel schedule, GFCI/AFCI, smoke/CO detectors.
12. **Final Plumbing** — Fixtures, water heater, gas connections, flow test.
13. **Final Mechanical** — HVAC startup, balancing, thermostat, combustion air.
14. **Final Building** — Everything complete. Egress, railings, stairs, smoke detectors, address posted.
15. **Certificate of Occupancy** — Issued after all finals pass. DO NOT OCCUPY before this.

## Permit Fee Estimation

Most jurisdictions calculate fees based on project valuation using ICC Building Valuation Data:

| Construction Type | $/sq ft (2025 BVD) |
|---|---|
| Residential (Type VB, wood frame) | $145-175 |
| Commercial Office (Type IIB) | $190-230 |
| Retail (Type IIB) | $155-185 |
| Restaurant (Type IIB) | $200-240 |
| Warehouse (Type IIB) | $95-120 |
| Mixed-Use (Type IIIA) | $175-215 |

**Fee formula (typical):**
- Building permit fee: 0.5%-1.5% of project valuation
- Plan review fee: 65% of building permit fee
- Electrical/Plumbing/Mechanical: $50-200 each (flat) or % of sub-valuation
- Impact fees: $2,000-$30,000+ (varies wildly by jurisdiction)
- School fees: $2-5/sq ft in many CA jurisdictions
- Park fees: $500-5,000 per unit (residential)
- Fire sprinkler plan review: $200-1,000

**Example — 2,000 sq ft house:**
- Valuation: 2,000 × $160 = $320,000
- Building permit: $320,000 × 1% = $3,200
- Plan review: $3,200 × 65% = $2,080
- Electrical: $150
- Plumbing: $150
- Mechanical: $150
- Total permit fees: ~$5,730 (before impact fees)

## Permit Expiration Rules

- Most building permits expire 180 days after issuance if work hasn't started
- Active permits typically expire 180 days after last inspection
- Extensions: 1-2 allowed, usually 180 days each, $50-200 fee
- Expired permit = new application + new fees + current code compliance
- Some jurisdictions have "sunset" provisions — 3-5 year max regardless of activity

## Owner-Builder Considerations

- Most states allow property owners to pull their own permits for personal residence
- Owner-builder must sign affidavit (not hiring contractor, personal residence, not for sale within 1 year)
- Still need licensed subs for electrical/plumbing/HVAC in many jurisdictions
- Some states require owner-builder exam (FL, NV)
- Resale disclosure required within 1-10 years depending on state
- NO owner-builder permits for commercial projects

## Red Flags That Trigger Extra Scrutiny

- Project in flood zone (FEMA SFHA) — elevation certificate, flood-proofing, substantial improvement calc
- Hillside/slope >15% — geotechnical report, special grading permit, retaining wall engineering
- Near wetlands or waterways — environmental review, Army Corps Section 404, state buffer requirements
- Historic district — preservation commission review, Secretary of Interior Standards
- Wildfire zone (WUI) — fire-rated materials, defensible space, Class A roof
- Seismic zone — enhanced structural requirements, special inspection requirements
- Coastal zone — Coastal Commission review, setback from mean high tide

## Contractor License Verification

Before pulling permits, verify your contractor's license:
- **California**: cslb.ca.gov
- **Florida**: myfloridalicense.com
- **Texas**: tdlr.texas.gov (limited — TX doesn't license general contractors statewide)
- **New York**: depends on municipality (NYC = DOB license)
- **National lookup**: No single national database — each state is separate
- Check: license status (active), insurance (current), bond (if required), complaints, disciplinary actions

## When You DON'T Need a Permit (Usually)

- Painting (interior/exterior, non-lead-based)
- Flooring replacement (same level, no subfloor structural changes)
- Cabinet replacement (no plumbing/electrical relocation)
- Landscaping (no grading, no retaining walls over 4 ft)
- Fencing under 6 ft (varies — some jurisdictions require permits for all fences)
- Minor repairs (replacing fixtures, faucets, outlets in same location)
- Window replacement (same size, same location, no structural modification)

**When in doubt, call your local building department. Unpermitted work = liability, insurance issues, sale complications.**
