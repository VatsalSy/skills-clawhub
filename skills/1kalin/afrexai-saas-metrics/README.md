# SaaS Metrics Dashboard

Calculate, benchmark, and diagnose your SaaS metrics in seconds. Covers the 15 numbers that actually determine whether your SaaS business is healthy — MRR, NRR, LTV:CAC, Burn Multiple, Rule of 40, and more.

Built for founders, CFOs, and operators who need a quick read on where they stand versus 2026 benchmarks (Pre-Seed through Series C+).

## What You Get

- All 15 core SaaS metrics calculated from your raw numbers
- 2026 stage-appropriate benchmarks (not 2019 data)
- Red/yellow/green flags with specific fix-it actions
- Board-ready output format
- Industry adjustments for vertical SaaS, PLG, and usage-based models

## Quick Start

Give your agent these numbers and ask it to run the SaaS metrics analysis:
- MRR, monthly churn rate, new customers, S&M spend, ARPU, gross margin, headcount, monthly burn

The skill handles the rest.
