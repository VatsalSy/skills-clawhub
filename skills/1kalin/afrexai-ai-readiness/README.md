# AI Readiness Assessment

Score your organization across 8 weighted dimensions. Get a clear readiness rating and a prioritized 90-day action plan — not a vague "you need AI" pitch.

## What It Does

- **8-dimension scoring** — Data, Process, Talent, Budget, Change Management, Security, Integration, Strategy
- **Weighted formula** — Security and data count more than buzzword alignment
- **Budget reality tables** — By company size, with actual ROI timelines
- **90-day action plan** — Foundation → Pilot → Scale or Kill
- **Industry benchmarks** — Know where you stand vs your sector (2026 data)
- **7 assessment mistakes** — Skip the expensive lessons others already learned

## Who It's For

CTOs, VPs of Engineering, COOs, and anyone who got asked "what's our AI strategy?" in a board meeting.

Works for 15-person startups through 1000+ enterprises.

## Quick Start

Tell your agent: "Run the AI readiness assessment for our company"

It'll walk through each dimension, score you, and produce the action plan.
