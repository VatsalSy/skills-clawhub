# Turing Pyramid — Future Enhancements

## v1.4+ Ideas

### Cross-need impact
Learning action satisfies understanding + competence simultaneously.
Publishing satisfies expression + recognition.
Social interaction satisfies connection + recognition.

### Expression intensity
CAPS and strong language amplify signal weight.
"confused" = 1 point, "COMPLETELY CONFUSED" = 2 points.

### Decay acceleration
Multiple negative events in short period accelerate decay.
3+ confusion signals in 1 hour = immediate sat drop.

### Topics within needs
Group actions by topic within each need.
Example:
```
expression:
  topics:
    scratchpad: [dump, develop]
    publishing: [write post, finish draft]
```
Maybe v2.0 feature.
