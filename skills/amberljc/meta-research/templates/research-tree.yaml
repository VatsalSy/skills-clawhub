# Research Tree — Hypothesis-Driven Project Structure
#
# This is the central data structure for a meta-research project.
# It tracks field understanding, hypotheses, experiments, and results
# in a single, version-controlled file.
#
# Usage: copy this template into your project root as `research-tree.yaml`
# and update it as your research progresses.
