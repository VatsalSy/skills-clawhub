> A skill that analyzes Python code and suggests optimizations for reducing memory usage.

I don't have access to the previous conversation context. Could you tell me what you were working on when the previous model attempt failed or timed out? That way I can pick up right where you left off.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --global openclaw-skill-py-memory-optimizer
```

The skill will automatically install Python dependencies on first run.
