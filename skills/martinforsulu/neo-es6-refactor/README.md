> A skill that automatically refactors JavaScript/TypeScript code to use modern ES6+ features and patterns.

I don't see any previous context or what you were working on before. Could you tell me what task you'd like me to continue with? I can help with:

- Reading/writing files
- Running commands
- Managing sessions
- Web searches
- And more

Just let me know what you need and I'll get started.
