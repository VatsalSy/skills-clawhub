# SKILLS — Available Skills Catalog

<!--
This is your agent's skill index. Load this file at session start (it's lightweight).
Load individual SKILL.md files only when a task actually needs them.
Part of: OpenClaw Skill Lazy Loader (clawhub install openclaw-skill-lazy-loader)
-->

## How to Use This Catalog

At session start: Read this file only (~300 tokens).
When you need a skill: Read the specific SKILL.md listed below.
Never load all skills at once — load on demand.

**Decision rule:** Before loading a skill file, ask: "Does my current task require this?" If no → skip.
