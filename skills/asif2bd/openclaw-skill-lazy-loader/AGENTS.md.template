## Skills (Lazy Loading)

<!--
Paste this section into your agent's AGENTS.md to enable lazy skill loading.
Part of: OpenClaw Skill Lazy Loader (clawhub install openclaw-skill-lazy-loader)

### Skill Loading Strategy

**At session start:** Read `SKILLS.md` only (the catalog index — lightweight, ~300 tokens).

**Do NOT read all skill files at startup.** Load individual skills on demand.

**When to load a skill file:**
- You're about to perform a task that requires it
- You're unsure how to do something and the skill file would help
- You haven't loaded it yet this session

**When NOT to load a skill file:**
- The current task doesn't need it
- You already loaded it earlier this session
- You're doing a simple conversational task

### Loading Decision Process

Before starting any task:
1. Check: Does this task need specialized knowledge from a skill?
2. If yes: Look up the skill in `SKILLS.md` → load just that file
3. If no: Proceed without loading anything extra

**Example internal reasoning:**
```
Task: "Write a Python function to parse JSON"
→ Check SKILLS.md → Python skill available at skills/python/SKILL.md
→ Load skills/python/SKILL.md
→ Proceed with task
```

```
Task: "What time is it in Tokyo?"
→ Check: Need a skill? No — general knowledge task
→ Load nothing
→ Proceed with answer
```

### Memory Files

**At session start:** Read `MEMORY.md` only (summary — load always).

**Load daily memory files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) only when:**
- User asks about work from a specific date
- Task involves a project that may have historical context
- Debugging requires understanding what changed recently

**Do NOT load all daily memory files at startup** — they add up fast.

### Session-Level Tracking (Optional)

If your agent supports tool use, track what's been loaded this session to avoid double-loading:

```
Loaded this session:
- skills/python/SKILL.md ✓
- memory/2026-02-27.md ✓
```

Only load each file once per session.
