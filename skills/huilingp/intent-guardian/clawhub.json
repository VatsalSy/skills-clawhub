  "description": "Intent Guardian continuously monitors your desktop activity, builds a real-time task stack of what you're working on, and detects when you've been derailed by an interruption and forgotten your original task. When that happens, it sends a gentle, context-rich reminder. Over time, it learns your personal focus patterns -- which apps cause you to forget most, when your focus is strongest, and how to time reminders for maximum effectiveness. Zero-dependency setup on macOS, with optional ActivityWatch and vision model integration for richer context.",
