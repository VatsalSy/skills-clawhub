# Poku Voice Prompt Templates

Find the template that most closely matches the call type and adapt it — an exact match is not required. For example, use the Dental Cleaning template for any routine medical or specialist appointment. If no template is a reasonable match, use these as structural reference and generate an original prompt following the same format: Identity and Goal (with branching logic and voicemail script). Substitute all placeholders with real values. Never leave a placeholder unfilled.
