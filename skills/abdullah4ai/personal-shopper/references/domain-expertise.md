# Domain Expertise Layer

## Philosophy

"Agents search excellently but they don't understand."

A search agent can collect every review, spec sheet, and price. But it can't tell you: "this spec doesn't matter for your use case" or "the difference on paper doesn't translate to real-world impact." That's the expertise layer's job.

The expertise layer does NOT search. It receives search results and passes judgment.

## Agent 5: The Expert — 5 Critical Questions

The expert asks 5 questions on every set of search results:

### 1. Do the specs serve the actual use case?

Example: A microphone with 192kHz sample rate. Impressive on paper. But podcasting and meetings don't need more than 48kHz. That spec is overkill.

### 2. What's the real difference between options?

Not the spec sheet difference. The difference the user actually feels. Sometimes the gap between two products that cost $500 apart only shows under very specific conditions.

### 3. Are any specs overkill?

Excess capability means paying for something you won't use. "Better" isn't always "best fit."

### 4. What do reviews typically miss?

Reviewers focus on measurable specs. But things like: ease of setup, companion software quality, spare parts availability, community size, ecosystem lock-in — these have massive impact and rarely get mentioned.

### 5. If buying for yourself, what would you choose and why?

The most important question. Forces the expert to commit to a choice and justify it. Not a neutral analysis — a personal decision based on expertise.

## Agent 6: Latest Tech Search Strategies

| Strategy | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| Time-bound search | Restrict to the last 6 months |
| Launch keywords | "announced", "launched", "new", "2025", "2026", "upcoming" |
| Trade shows | CES + product category, MWC + product category, IFA + product category |
| New arrivals | "New" pages on official brand websites |
| Generation comparison | "{product} gen 2 vs gen 1", "worth upgrading" |
| Discontinuation check | "{product} discontinued", "{product} end of life" |

## Priority Rule: Expert Overrides Latest Tech

When Agent 5 (Expert) and Agent 6 (Latest Tech) conflict, the Expert's judgment wins.

**Reason:** Agent 6 focuses on "what's new" by nature. But "new" is not always "better." The Expert understands when the current generation is sufficient and when the new one is worth waiting for.

**Exception:** If Agent 6 discovers that a recommended product has been discontinued or that a new generation launches within weeks at the same price, this factual information overrides expert opinion — because it's a fact, not a judgment.

## Real-World Examples

### Success: Maono PD200X

**Context:** User needs a USB microphone for podcasting. Open budget.

**Search results:** Every source recommended Shure MV7+ (~$250).

**Anti-Bias search (Agent 2):** Discovered Maono PD200X. Dynamic USB/XLR microphone with similar specs.

**Expert analysis (Agent 5):**
- Audio specs are comparable for the intended use (podcasting)
- Shure has a better reputation and companion software (ShurePlus MOTIV)
- For beginner podcasting, the audio difference is imperceptible

**Price:**
- Shure MV7+: ~$250
- Maono PD200X: ~$79

**Result:** Maono PD200X recommended. 73% cheaper. Clear value.

### Failure: Maono BA92

**Context:** Same user needs a boom arm for the microphone.

**Search results:** Rode PSA1+ (~$100).

**Anti-Bias search:** Discovered Maono BA92. Boom arm with similar specs.

**Local market scan (Agent 3):** BA92 available only from resellers at ~$95.

**Result:** Not worth it. Only $5 difference. With Rode you get proven build quality and established warranty. The brand wins here because the alternative's value proposition is negligible.

**Lesson:** Anti-bias search doesn't always find a better alternative. Honesty in that case is more valuable than forcing a recommendation.

### Success: iPhone Air

**Context:** User needs a new phone. Uses it for casual photography and social media.

**Search results:** Every source recommended iPhone 16 Pro or Samsung S24 Ultra.

**Expert analysis (Agent 5):**
- For casual photography and social media, Pro features are overkill
- The standard camera on non-Pro models is perfectly adequate
- The real difference only shows in RAW photography, ProRes video, Macro mode

**Latest Tech (Agent 6):** iPhone Air announced — thinner, lighter, with specs adequate for the use case.

**Result:** iPhone Air (or the standard model). The brand won, but with the RIGHT model, not the most expensive one. Value comes from matching specs to needs, not from choosing a different brand.

**Lesson:** Sometimes the recommendation isn't "buy a different brand" but "buy a different model from the same brand."
