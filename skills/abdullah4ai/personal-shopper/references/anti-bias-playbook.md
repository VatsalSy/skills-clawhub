# Anti-Bias Playbook

## Why Normal Search Returns the Same Results

| Bias | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Survivorship Bias | Popular products get more reviews, rank higher in search, get more reviews. A closed loop. |
| Echo Chamber | Same reviewers review the same products. Wirecutter recommends X, Reddit discusses X, YouTube reviews X. |
| LLM Training Bias | AI models trained on the same repeated content reflect the same bubble in their recommendations. |
| Affiliate Bias | Products with higher affiliate commissions get promoted more regardless of quality. |

## The 6 Reverse Search Strategies

| # | Strategy | Method | Example |
|---|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Negative Search | Search for flaws in popular products: "{product} problems", "why I returned {product}" | "Shure MV7 problems podcast" |
| 2 | Brand Alternatives | Search for lesser-known brands: "{category} {brand}" | "USB microphone Maono", "USB microphone Fifine" |
| 3 | Origin-Based | Search by country of origin: "best {category} Japanese", "best {category} Korean" | "best headphones Chinese audiophile" |
| 4 | Price-Point | Search by price, not brand: "best {category} under $50" | "best microphone under 200 SAR" |
| 5 | Professional Community | Search what professionals use: "what {professionals} actually use" | "what podcasters actually use microphone reddit" |
| 6 | Non-English | Search in other languages for region-specific recommendations | Arabic, Japanese, Korean product reviews |

**Important:** The goal is to EXPAND the horizon, not to exclude popular options. If reverse search confirms that the popular product is genuinely the best, that is a valid result.

## Red Flags in Reviews

| Flag | Description | How to Detect |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Sponsored Content | Paid review disguised as genuine recommendation | Check disclosure, count affiliate links, see if any negatives mentioned |
| Echo Chamber | All sources trace back to the same original review | Track the primary source; if all cite Wirecutter, that's one source |
| Upselling | Review always pushes toward the most expensive option | Notice: is "the best" always the priciest without clear technical justification? |
| Affiliate Bias | Ranking reflects commission rates, not quality | High-commission products consistently placed first |
| Honeymoon Reviews | All reviews from the first month of ownership | No long-term reliability data; initial excitement skews perception |

## Evaluating Unknown Brands

### Quick Check (5 minutes)

1. Official website: does it exist with clear company information?
2. Company age: check LinkedIn or Crunchbase
3. Reddit search: "{brand} review" — are there real users?
4. Amazon reviews: read the 3-star reviews specifically (most honest)
5. Support: search "{brand} warranty" or "{brand} customer service"

### Deep Check (15 minutes)

1. Find the actual manufacturer (many brands use the same factory)
2. Compare actual technical specs, not marketing specs
3. Search for teardown or disassembly videos
4. Check the brand's product history (is this their first product?)
5. Check for an authorized distributor locally

### When to Trust an Unknown Brand

- Real users praise it after 6+ months of use
- The company has a track record in the category (not their first product)
- Clear warranty and reachable customer support
- The price difference is large enough (30%+ cheaper) to justify the risk

### When to Avoid

- All reviews are from the first month (honeymoon reviews)
- No local distributor and no warranty
- Price is close to the known brand (why take the risk?)
- The company has no successful prior products
