# Market Dynamics — Saudi Market

## Price Inversion

Price Inversion: when a product costs more locally than its international price + shipping + customs. Common in the Saudi market due to distribution layers.

Not every price gap counts as Price Inversion. The gap must exceed 30% to be noteworthy, because local purchasing has inherent advantages: local warranty, easy returns, fast delivery.

## 4 Pricing Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Price Impact | Example |
|---------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Direct Distribution | Company sells directly via its own store | Close to international price | Apple Store SA, Samsung SA |
| Reseller/Importer | Third party imports and sells on Amazon/noon | 20-60% above international | Most small brands on Amazon.sa |
| Official Distributor | Authorized distributor with official contract | 10-25% above with local warranty | Jarir as distributor for many brands |
| Exclusive Product | Product designed specifically for the local market | No international comparison available | Some STC devices |
