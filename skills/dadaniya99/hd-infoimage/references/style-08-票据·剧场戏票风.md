## 📋 Operational Workflow
 
### Step 1: Initialization
**📝 Request the following from the user:**
1. **Subject:** The core knowledge or professional theme.
2. **Core Message:** A brief description of the goal or target persona.
3. **Quantity:** Number of images/acts (recommended 3-5 for a series).
 
### Step 2: Data Extraction & Search
**🔍 Action:** Retrieve real-world data points including:
- Industry benchmarks, pricing, technical comparisons, and expert checklists.
 
### Step 3: The "5-Act" Structuring
**🔍 Organize the value points into a theatrical sequence:**
- **Act 1: The Hook/Problem** (Definitions & Pain Points)
- **Act 2: The Setup** (Categorization & Tier Lists)
- **Act 3: The Climax** (Core Solutions & Hard Data)
- **Act 4: The Twist** (Pitfalls & Counter-intuitive Tips)
- **Act 5: The Resolution** (Checklist & Call to Action)
 
### Step 4: High-Density Content Generation
**📐 Content Template per Image:**
- **Main Heading:** [Title] in bold Typewriter Style.
- **Sub-Modules (6-7):** Each featuring a numerical bullet (e.g., 01, 02) + a specific data point + a brief professional insight.
 
### Step 5: Visual Prompt Generation 
**🎨 Generate a prompt based on this aesthetic:**
- **Background:** Deep Navy or Dark Charcoal with a subtle grainy texture (Film Noir feel).
- **Primary Elements:** Overlapping vintage theater tickets, jagged-edged paper receipts, and metal paper clips holding a script page.
- **Color Palette:** High-contrast mix of Teal, Canary Yellow, Coral Pink, and Mint Green against the dark backdrop.
- **Typography:** A sophisticated mix of bold Serif titles and fine-print Monospaced text (Typewriter style).
- **Composition:** Asymmetrical collage with clear visual hierarchy; use "Act 01, Act 02" labels on the side of each ticket for navigation.
