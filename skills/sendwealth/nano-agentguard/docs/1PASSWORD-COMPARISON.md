## Workflow Comparison

### 1Password (Human Workflow)

```
Human needs password
    ↓
Open 1Password app
    ↓
Authenticate (FaceID/TouchID)
    ↓
Search for credential
    ↓
Copy to clipboard
    ↓
Paste where needed
```

### AgentGuard (Agent Workflow)

```
Agent needs credential
    ↓
Check permission scope
    ↓
Is operation dangerous?
    ├─ No → Return credential
    └─ Yes → Request human approval
              ↓
         Human approves/denies
              ↓
         Return credential or reject
    ↓
Log to audit trail
```

### Integrated Workflow

```
Agent needs credential
    ↓
Check permission scope
    ↓
Is operation dangerous?
    ├─ No → Get from local cache
    └─ Yes → Request human approval
              ↓
         Human approves (via 1Password biometric)
              ↓
         Sync from 1Password to local cache
    ↓
Return credential
    ↓
Log to audit trail
    ↓
Sync audit to 1Password (optional)
```

## Use Case Examples

### Scenario 1: Daily Web Browsing (Human)

**Use 1Password**
- Human logs into Gmail
- 1Password autofills password
- Simple, fast, human-friendly

### Scenario 2: AI Agent Checking Email (Agent)

**Use AgentGuard**
- Agent wants to read inbox
- Permission check: `read` operation → auto-approved
- Agent gets API key from vault
- Operation logged to audit trail

### Scenario 3: AI Agent Sending Email (Agent)

**Use AgentGuard with Human Gate**
- Agent wants to send email
- Permission check: `send_email` is dangerous
- Human Gate: Push notification to owner
- Owner approves with biometric (via 1Password)
- Agent gets temporary credential
- Email sent, logged to audit trail

### Scenario 4: Multiple Devices (Human + Agent)

**Use 1Password + AgentGuard**
- Store master password in 1Password
- Sync credentials across devices via 1Password
- Local cache in AgentGuard for offline access
- Best of both worlds

---

## Security Model

### 1Password Security
- **Master Password**: Human-memorable, high entropy
- **Secret Key**: Device-specific, adds 2FA
- **Biometric**: FaceID/TouchID for quick access
- **Zero Knowledge**: 1Password can't see your data

### AgentGuard Security
- **Master Password**: Stored in 1Password (never on disk)
- **Per-Agent Encryption**: Each agent has separate container
- **Permission Boundaries**: Agent can only access what's allowed
- **Audit Trail**: Every operation logged with hash chain
- **Human Gate**: Dangerous operations require human confirmation

### Integrated Security
- Master password from 1Password (biometric protected)
- Local encrypted cache (offline access)
- Permission checks on every operation
- Human approval for dangerous actions
- Complete audit trail

## Cost Comparison

| | 1Password | AgentGuard |
|---|-----------|------------|
| **Personal** | $2.99/month | Free |
| **Teams** | $7.99/user/month | Free |
| **Enterprise** | $7.99/user/month | Free |
| **Self-hosted** | ❌ | ✅ |

**Recommendation**: Use 1Password for human passwords, AgentGuard for agent credentials. Total cost: $2.99/month.

## When to Use What?

### Use 1Password Only
- Personal password management
- Team password sharing
- Human-focused workflows

### Use AgentGuard Only
- AI agent credential management
- Permission boundaries needed
- Audit trails required
- No cross-device sync needed

### Use Both (Recommended)
- Humans + AI agents in same environment
- Need both human and agent workflows
- Want cross-device sync + offline access
- Want biometric auth + permission boundaries

## Migration Path

### From 1Password to AgentGuard

```bash
# 1. Install AgentGuard
npm install -g agentguard

# 2. Enable 1Password integration
agentguard op enable

# 3. Import credentials
# (Manual: copy from 1Password to AgentGuard)

# 4. Update agents to use AgentGuard API
```

### Starting Fresh

```bash
# 1. Install both
brew install 1password-cli
npm install -g agentguard

# 2. Setup 1Password
op signin

# 3. Setup AgentGuard with 1Password
agentguard init
agentguard op enable

# 4. Register agents
agentguard register my-agent --owner "you@example.com"

# 5. Store credentials
agentguard vault store my-agent API_KEY xxx
```

## Summary

| | Best For |
|---|----------|
| **1Password** | Human password management, team sharing |
| **AgentGuard** | Agent credential management, permissions, audit |
| **Both** | Complete solution for humans + agents |

**They complement each other, they don't compete.**
